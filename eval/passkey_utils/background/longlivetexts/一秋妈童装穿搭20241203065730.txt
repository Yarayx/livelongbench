I gave it to you.
Turned into a man.
Don't spread it to me.
I don't know about the cold.
Don't tell anyone?
Give it to the dog?
There are currently no reported cases.

A man keeps your hair down.
A man keeps your hair down.
It's a good look.
Yes, it is.
Recently popular short hair
And then it's mainly easy to wash your head.
He hasn't washed his head for two, three, four days.
He's got the smell of oil on his head.
And then I told Mom to take you for a haircut in the fall.
I'm not sure I want to.
I told him I had short hair.
Then show him the photos to others.
You look at this, you see this.
Is it short hair?
This short hair has a good temperament.
I'm mostly comfortable washing my hair.
Because he hates washing his head too.
All right, then.
Then cut it off.
After cutting
He said he was ugly.
And sometimes it's nice.
Then I took him to the design department.
All the designers
Give him positive emotional value
Oh, my God.
That's good.
It's beautiful.
In the blink of an eye, stars came.
So I'm going to praise this.
I want others to praise me.
I can't boast.
You'd think you'd be proud of him.
You lied to me.
He tricked me into shaving my head.
Don't you like it?
You're lying to me.
But others say differently.
So I took it to the design department that day.
I tried two dresses.
Put on a baseball cap
Oh, my God.
The emotional value of the designer
It's not easy.
Confidence is coming.
I'm confident in him.
He's feeling really bad.
When I'm taking pictures and making videos
It's fun.
So when you're educating children,
It's got to be a stack.
It's the design department.
That's a must.
We also have long hair.
It's too much trouble.
Washing your head is a waste of time.
I'm going to blow my hair.
I'm getting bored.
Short hair blowing hair
Oh, my God.
That one.
That's great.

Can you not ask me to be the host?
It's very strange.
We're going to have to call a sister-in-law.
That's great.
I don't want to be a salesman.
I want to be your caring child.
I'm often ten minutes late for work.
What class was that?
Why haven't you been fired?
This is a company that is open.
This is a company that is open.
You're going to work for my sister.
You've been fired before.
I'm telling you.
You've been fired 18 times.
She's worried about being late.

It's on tape now.
You won't.
I was real.
It's true.
Now it's possible to record it.
It's safe.
Autumn is not broadcast
Autumn is a leather jacket?
I did it for you.
I've been comfortable wearing this leather jacket for two days.
It's this protein skin.
Isn't it popular today?
$310
After I ran out of blue oil that day,
I just found the original fire door.
It's so expensive now.
I used to think blue oil was sunny.
Now I think the fire doors are too expensive.
This is a 310 dollar leather jacket.
Where's the line?
I did it.
Aunt did it.
Spring for you.
It'll be spring next week or so.
It's not the end of the year.
That's right.
Clean up every day before 3:30 am
It's clear
I still don't close at 6:00 in the morning.
I'm here today.
I won't tell you tomorrow.

Do you have a link to the link?
My coat is really nice.
Yes, I did.
Guangdong has cooled down for two days
I found a situation.
It's just that I might have had a baby.
I'm wearing a pair of jeans.
The colder I get, the colder it gets.
The colder it gets.
And then I was in Guangdong for two days.
I'm wearing a good-looking collar.
Especially in the lower half.
It's a woman.
The other half is skinny.
It's your whole body.
It feels like there's that kind of nose.
The nostrils come out of their own pockets
It's hard to get cold.
I don't know if you're
On the contrary.
So I'm at home.
Or just put a blanket over your knee.
It's a good-looking dress.

Don't mess with me.
That's what I'm all about.
It's like giving birth to a baby.
So it's easy to catch a cold.
You've got a cold.
So I'd rather wear a little warm and warm.
I don't want to say.
What a beautiful move.
It's not necessarily the body.
I feel a little uncomfortable.
It's going to be hard.
Yes, I did.
And put on a garment that will be well-dressed.
Yes, it is.
Is that bracelet still for sale?
Can't sell it
You're right, too.
So now that I'm older,
I'm 38 years old.
I'm not too old.
I am what I am now.
I'll give myself some warmth.
I can wear a jacket
I'm going to wear a jacket.
Even if I sweat a little on my back.
I'd like to wear a jacket.
I'm not leaving.
It's cold.
It's a real cold.
You see, your feathers are fading again.
Oh, my God.
What's wrong with you?
What's that?

It's a matter of getting dressed.
Oh, I can't get up.
I came up to you last year.
I'll give you an added version.
Make a version that is not merged
Last year.
That's the one I'm wearing in my closet.
I bought a lot of them back.
Because I think they're beautiful.
I bought it back to study.
And you know that.
I used to just feel comfortable.
It's not the style or the format.
So now I'm going to start learning how to type.
The style.
So I keep coming back and studying.
I bought a lot of hard ones.
As long as you like to talk about what you're wearing right now.
Then you can buy it next year.
Yes, I did.
And then, until I bought the one about a nun.
Mom, I finally got my day.
So sometimes I buy a copy, buy a day dress.
Don't tell me it's hard for you to go to all the live channels.
People like us who make clothes go out and buy them.
It's hard to buy a copy on Taobao.
I really bought it back.
Oh, girls' and boys' dresses.
I bought about six.
I don't know.
I finally figured that out.
That's a good one.
Then soft again.
It's soft.
I'm just waiting for you to figure it out.
Do not hurry.
Don't be in a hurry
Oh, come on now.
Oh, my God.

My T-shirt is really nice.
This T-shirt, I think.
I thought I was going to the moon.
If I hadn't made the moon then.
I think this T-shirt should sell at least 120,000 copies.
This is really nice to wear.
I wear it every day.
It's really, really everyday.
I'll wear this at home.
Or wear that last couple of days.

Your brother's got a monopoly.
Yeah, that's a lot.
Because I've been wearing it a lot lately.
I'm about to sell.
Why do I wear it so often?
Because it's nice.
This thing is not for you to recommend.
It's because I feel good about myself.
It's sold out.
I'll wear it more often later.
That's not selling.
Not for video recording.
It's a brother who feels really good.
It's all about what you've left.
It's nice to be alone.
'Cause I got a big chest right now.
I went out to buy T-shirts and I was nervous.
I'll give you a look at our house and we'll split it up.
And then it's all right.
I decided not to breastfeed.
There is a sense of loss.
I've been a little lost lately.
I don't think autumn needs me anymore.
What is it?
You're a good swordsman.

This is the T-shirt I wear every day at home.
Because it's that.
It's a beautiful piece of fabric.
Yes, I did.
It's the fabric of your mind.
I'm old.
Do you remember wearing these T-shirts and underwear?
A little thick.
There are two benefits.
On the one hand, it's not easy to get cold.
It's not easy to grow old and cool down.
The second word
It's a little thick fabric wound.
It's going to be cool.
We've got a lot of people on our backs.
Wearing too thin fabrics
It's not gonna feel good.
Wearing this thick fabric
It's got a bit of texture.
You see?
Sorry about that.
Such a big chest.
Dressed in thick fabrics
You can't see.

Don't lose it.
If you're not careful, you'll catch cold.
Oh, my God.
You ask the boss.
I feel a little uncomfortable physically
Uncomfortable
I didn't want to do it.
Yes, it is painful.
So I don't think people can get a little bit of pain.
It's a little painful.
You're not happy.
No feeling of happiness
Yes, I did.
So you can wear a little thick.
And don't say I'm beautiful because of it.
I'm going to be a little thin.
No one cares how beautiful you are.
It's a good thing to do with this type of pumpkin.
It's nice to wear.

It's just you.
I can't say that.

My mom didn't say yes.
That's really good.

It's so good for this necklace.
You can wear it in Guangdong
I wear it every day in Guangdong.
Yes, I did.
I wear it every day.
Because these two days I'm up early because of me.
I got up early.
I'm wearing those thin jeans.
Didn't I buy a lot of thin jeans in a women's clothing store?
Yes, I did.
I'm going to get some of that cool air.
It's the humidity of Guangdong.
It's so wet and cold
Oh, my God.
It's a feeling of entering the body.
Then it's in the nose.
It's a little bit of acidic.
And then there's the feeling of wanting to run out of breath.
I'm scared of colds.
If you can't afford it
That nose can't hold up.
I got a cold right away.
