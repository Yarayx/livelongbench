If you like the gesture,
Let's have a look.
I like it.
You are hanging.
What cards do you want?
High speed, very, very high.
A thick one that you can see.
That's the kind of clothing that's going to be a tie.
What do you do with plastic braces?
But we're all tied up.
The move
What's up?
There are also earrings.
You can look at this little detail first.
This one belongs to that one too.
Look at the two colors.
We post back.
Put it on.
Put it on.
Put it back.
That's good.
Let me show you.
That feeling.
It's a self-contained thing.
Let me show you.
Is this a big deal?
Oh, my God.
This promise
This promise
I deleted it.
Point of Reservation
This is a 220-colored dragon.
Clothes
It seems too yellow.
That's what we're doing.
Right now.
It's a good color too.
It wasn't given to you.
Deep grey
I think the deep gray looks good.
Deep gray compared to special
I've been working on designing and running a clothing line.
He's dressed like that.
But it's too long in there.
I said it's not that.
Does that look good?
It looks good.
Clothes It's this
It's this one.
It's red.
The chain is like this.
Oh, my God.
You go.
I'm with 77.
I'll show you the next one.
This one.
By linking
It's a little darker than that.
And then it feels cool.
Let's get some more oil.
It's one of them.
A small sleeve against the wind
And then what?
Little Hat
It's a good color, too.
It's the same color.
It's a light gray.
The feeling of gray blue
It looks fresh.
That's right.
It's nice to see it fresh.
Link number two
It's a lot of fun.
I'll give it to you.
The mating of that monkey
You can see it first.
This is it.
We feel like we're a bunch.
The sweater inside.
Oh, my God.
The sweater inside
This is a lovely sweater.
Yes, I did.
It's also gray.
And it does.
The front.
You see, it's a bear.
Then it's here.
The feeling of dancing
And then there's this cowboy's little necklace.
And then there's this little card.
The butterflies all look good.
This is our home link number two.
Is that true?
Yes, I did.
This little jacket.
Everyone can go and make a reservation.
It's a feeling of a set of grays.
Then the jacket is linked to number two.
We've been there before.
You guys put on this jacket.
We can do it with our sweaters.
Yes, I did.
The word "coat" is number three.
Then our coat is linked to number two.
We're going to have to take a look.
Then we'll wait for you to change our collars.
Oh, my God.
Yes, it is.
Let's take a look.
It's going to give you a pair of boxers.
Oh, my God.
I always thought this belt was a little too much.
I got it first.
This belt I feel.
I don't need to wear this.
That's the bottom.
Get the fuck out.
The bottom of the purple peak looks bad.
It's very crowded.
We're really trying to say
One looks better than the other.
It's all designed.
And then two colors.
It's also thicker inside.
You don't have to worry.
What kind of warmth do you wear?
It was very, very warm.
There's also a naked line.
Yes, I did.
I would have liked this one better.
Some of the nudes are good.
Oh, my God.
Some of the nudes are good.
This one is there.
This one's pale pink.
Both colors look good.
Instead, you're going to have to do it in the fall.
It doesn't look too good.
Other people's underwear
I don't have a sense of design.
Then your winter's bottom.
It looks so good.
It's amazing.
That's right.
It's beautiful.
You've got one out there.
It's just that little grass.
It's a coat.
It's beautiful.
I can get you one.
The little white coat.
It's here.
Let's see.
There's a butterfly knot on top.
There's also a small decoration.
And then there's the lace over here.
I've done a lot of things.
It's like a lace.
There's also a bone marrow lace.
I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to do that.
Come with me.
The pants look good too.
The pants are like this.
Actually, you don't have to do this.
It's got letters on it, even in one piece.
Oh, my God.
What did I say?
Come with me.
The trousers are on our third link.
