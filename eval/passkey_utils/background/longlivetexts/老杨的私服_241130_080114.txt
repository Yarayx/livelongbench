Drumming glaciers in Kawasaki
Yes, I did.
Do you have a drum kit?
It's a good day for you.
We're open to anyone with a handbook.
Don't remember getting it.
The hardworking people are watching.
I'm on the job.
And the lazy are still asleep.
I'm still in my sleep.
What is the name of my hair?
Fans
It's the worst.
A baby of his own making.
It's got its own hair.
Every time you start a new product, you feel like you've bought it before.
That's what's wrong.
Oh, yeah.
Choose your baby.
Because our house is always upset.
That you see a different man every time
I never thought your husband meant anything.
Ha-ha-ha!
Add to it.
And then there was no milk.
The water bleeds directly.
I'll buy you some milk for your senior year.
Oh, my God.
It's a good look every time it goes live.
She looks the same every time.
I'll just draw a table.
Let's see.
The sound of a high-pitched soft-belly
Oh, my God.
There's a white blanket in there. Help me find it.
The one who twisted his ass.
Oh, my God.
I'm going to paint a white canvas.
I can.
Oh, my God.
Haji is welcome to take the big mosquitoes to his sisters, Kama.
I don't see it.
It's starting again.
Oh, my God.
It's the boots.
Wait a minute, boots.
I'll give it to you.
Put it on.
Oh, my God.
Because I thought it was white.
It's a little clean in pink and white.
The word yellow doesn't seem so clean.
Yes, I did.
You look at it like this, and it feels so clean.
Oh, my God, I look so good.
Oh, my God.
The dream of buying clothes
Haji welcomes the sisters in the live broadcast
I'm already 3,000.
Three minutes, three thousand people were hurt.
Oh, my God.
It's hard to hurt yourself.
Give yourself a compliment.
Today is also a day of great pride.
Yes, it is.
Oh, my God.
You can't have a pair of pants.
Oh, my God.
Give me the gray guard and the blue trousers.
I'll give you an example.
Isn't that right?
No, not at all.
He's the unchallenged baby.
It's the size of three and eight.
Oh, my God.
There's also a turtle.
That's it.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Then we're just gonna start dressing up like this.
Yes, it is.
The trumpet pants won't go up today.
Trumpet pants on today
It's just that I don't have a fan.
Do you think this fan can wear other clothes?
Yes, it is.
First of all, this fan, even though it's covering his ass.
But it's not that long.
Oh, my God.
It's not about the length of the knee.
Yes, it is.
So we're going to have a gray pants today.
I'm wearing my underwear.
I'm going to get you all these gray pants.
It can also be worn in ashtrays.
That's the one.
Yes, it is.
Grey and pink is a relatively casual set.
Yes, it is.
It's comfortable.
And then the pink trousers are a little more communicable.
Oh, my God.
This is a set.
Yes, I did.
This is the first question I'm going to answer.
That's the fan silk on me.
Yes, it is.
The coat.
It's fun to wear.
Oh, yes, you can.
And then the second thing was this dress I was wearing.
It's called Chardonnay.
First of all, it must be silk.
It's easy to peel.
But this thing in me, it's a fan silk.
It's not black.
So it's not like it doesn't have hair.
Yes, it is.
It's only one color.
Black, will you buy it?
You won't buy it either.
Oh, yeah.
The sleeve we hit is a white one.
It's not pink.
It's over here.
From the inside, it's a feather.
It's cleaner.
All right, let's go.
Wait a minute.
And then I'll tell you about it.
What's new in today's top five?
Because there are a lot of fans now.
I didn't see any cold yesterday.
It's too hot.
Yes, it is.
I don't want to go live.
For one, it's the pink in me.
The second dress
Today's second dress
It's this one.
This is the one I was photographing playing drums on the glacier.
Yes, I did.
And then this dress is handwritten.
I'm wearing this dress and I've got a check.
But I've been doing this black thing for seven days.
Pre-sold
Oh, my God.
T-linked
You're right.
If you could just wait to get out of here, this dress would be really nice.
It actually has T-shaped welding.
Yes, I did.
Yes, it is.
I don't know.
They're all tied up in the 34th.
Oh, yeah.
So what's the third dress?
Let me tell you about it.
This is a leather one.
She's very protective.
The Cowboy Party
The Cowboy Party
Oh, my God.
It's a piece of real fur.
It's really hairy.
Yes, I did.
And then the cowboy.
In the cow, the compound is feathers.
That's the third one.
This is the third.
Let's have a look.
I'm going to tell you what the top five are.
Oh, my God.
And then the fourth.
There's one in our house.
That one.
That's great.
The Milk Bears.
Yes, it is.
It's a super big old customer in our house.
He named the dress.
This is the fourth.
That's right.
This is our Caribbean coast.
This is the fourth.
Oh, my God.
And then it's the perfect match for who these two clothes are.
Very suitable for Southern customers
Oh, my God.
If you think you can buy one or two, that's enough.
I can't even wear that thick.
It's perfectly suited for this.
Yes, it is.
It's also great for Southern sisters to wear.
So what's the fifth?
The fifth is this.
And that's the thing about Kolkata.
It's also one for the sisters in the North.
Yes, I did.
The sisters in the South can go too.
I'm going to have to pay the security deposit.
But in all the Kuroda series that we've seen so far,
The highest number of passengers is more than 320.
Yes, I did.
More than 320 grams and a length above the knee.
Oh, my God.
The Kuroda series
And then there's this one with the bill.
She'll be able to get her sister in a feathered suit in seven days.
Yes, it is.
Oh, my God.
The North can't afford to buy it.
Hold on a second.
And then these are the top five.
We'll give you a little bit of a breakthrough.
That's right.
And then my T-shirt.
My pants.
My shoes.
My earplugs.
It's all there today.
There is.
Why don't you join the fan club?
You can't go to the fan club.
That's not you.
Let the client teach you.
Yes, I did.
Oh, my God.
Yesterday, the second one was the gray shorts.
Oh, my God.
And then when I'm done wearing my underwear,
And then when you first put on your panties, you put on that jacket.
That's right.
Oh, my God.
It's OK.
We're all going to get out of here.
I think it's almost like that.
And then the hair bracelet to the hair-bracelet.
Red haired collar
Let me tell you, baby.
It's like this.
It's all fox hair on the outside.
And then there's fur in it.
The fox's hair is completely intact when he comes home.
But there's something about hair.
You're going home and you've got your hair done.
I've got my braces all torn off.
It hasn't lost a hair.
Yes, I did.
It's also the first haircut I've ever had.
And then there's the whole thing.
Oh, my God.
And then I'm going to put this pink one on you today.
This one's a feather suit.
Good to see you.
That's good.
It's very, very good.
There's this bag.
This package is a small benefit for everyone today.
He was hanged an hour ago today.
Oh, my God.
You can compare it.
We had a big one before.
Yes, it is.
Thousands have forgotten.
1314 I forgot about it.
Yes, I did.
This bag is a real leather one today.
Give a little benefit to all my sisters
We've been out before.
Can you ring a bell with your shoe?
This package gives all my sisters a little benefit.
I can.
I'm sure you want this package.
Two sets of boots on my feet
On my feet.
That's what he's wearing on his feet.
Well, I'm getting ready to start today.
I can.
And then I joined our fans.
What's new today?
So we officially started today.
You want pink on me?
Ready to take the ticket.
What about this dress?
I didn't do the T welding.
Because you're in a hurry.
In fact, if you could just wait until the next one.
It's T-shaped.
Yes, I did.
But I'm going to hang this upright.
Three o'clock
Point One
We've got 95 white marshmallows in there.
Subdued
Don't feel like talking to him.
Oh, my God, isn't that a little full?
It's only about 50 grams.
About 70 grams.
It has a full capacity of 40 meters.
It's already 165 grams.
Oh, my God.
Almost as much as the collection.
Yes, it is.
But because of its relatively dense flight path,
I'm going to have to squeeze this out.
The actual degree of warming
It's very, very powerful.
Yes, it is.
Because it's almost 200 grams.
That's the first point.
Point two
This is the pink silk we make for you.
Then look at this position on my shoulder.
It's actually going to shine.
Yes, it is.
When I was on the air with that little number yesterday,
The lights are on or the sun is shining.
The effect will be even more obvious.
Oh, my God.
And then the third point is this dress.
What we're doing to everyone is a long arm.
Cover your ass.
If the other half is missing
She was more anxious in her lower half.
You're an anxious customer.
He's got a wrist.
Shorts
It's not like I don't want to wear pants.
It's all good.
It's a pink and gray color to go with these panties.
Oh, my God!
Yes, it is.
Let's get ready for the first weld.
I don't want to be in a hurry.
Oh, my God.
This dress is for business.
It's a direct fight.
Our dress is set for 189 today.
1850 is right.
Yes, I did.
We're going to get the first weld.
The first episode aired live - 300

3 of them
Connecting number 1
How did you like this dress yesterday?
All the sisters on the screen know.
Yes, I did.
That's not 1850.
1650 I told you.
I'm selling a second.
1550 You're going to get it.
No. 1 is hosting the meeting.
It's a surprise.
Let's see the whole thing.
All the buttons in our house
It's all pink silk.
Yes, it is.
It's this pink silk.
We're with the deep pink silk.
I'm going to do a color-coding.
They're all uniform colors.
Yes, it is.
And I'll give you a backpack.
It's a very fine two words.
That's right.
It's very soft.
It's very soft.
It's the color of the pollen.
Oh, my God.
It's not like that.
It's a very dark pink skin.
No, it's that pale pink.
Yes, it is.
It's very light.
I suggest you take a big shot.
This is because the fabric itself is not elastic.
Yes, I did.
I'd recommend that you take a shot.
If Karma were to
You don't have to hit me on purpose.
It's really good.
For the sake of my clothes.
It's just that our version itself is much bigger.
You don't have to do it on purpose.
That's good.
My hairy sister, wait a minute.
Get on your horse.
This dress.
I'll take a look at the back.
Its back is not shorter than its front.
In fact, you buy a lot of other people's clothes.
It's just that they're all feeling a little rusty in the back.
Yes, I did.
Why isn't our home in the back?
It's because if everyone's free,
We put our clothes on the floor.
If the floor is flat
You'll find that the back is longer than the front.
First and last.
Yes, it is.
It's the only way I'm going to be able to achieve that.
Yes, it is.
There is no pregnancy.
400 eggs.
You give me 100 more eggs like that.
Do I need to get my hair done?
Give me another 100.
It's 321.
Get the number one weld.
I don't have the whole shell 1 wire.
Customers 1550
Yes, it is.
What you get is 95 tons.
The fabric is made of Lysergic Acid.
They're all in their pockets.
It is very convenient to wear.
If you're wearing this dress, how does it feel to your neck?
I'll give you this bracelet right away.
Yes, I did.
Spring and Autumn
The monkeys can only wear them.
In the winter, they wear sweaters and braids.
It's the kind of shirt that moms can wear.
You can survive the winter.
But you're saying that the sisters in the north can't wear them outdoors.
I wouldn't recommend it.
Yes, I did.
The sisters in the north
And you can't say that every fleece is thick.
Sorry about that.
Take a look inside.
It's all in pink.
It's pink in color.
If you put on a sweater, you won't swell.
There will be no feeling of colorful friction.
Don't get fat
There's no white at all, only pink.
Oh, my God.
I don't buy white.
I'm sure I'll buy pink.
It's almost white pink.
Sorry about that.
Come on, get your hair done like this.
Pink is lighter.
Yes, it is.
You're going to have to help me draw 500 pieces of this stuff.
It's all 550 now.
There are now 500 of them.
Give me another 50.
Now the whole screen says I didn't get it.
Number one, grab yourself and take it.
Yes, it is.
Open that bracelet.
That's good.
This hair led me to tell you something.
All the sisters in Laos today
Buy a coat for anyone without a collar
Everyone can wear this bracelet.
I can.
I've got all my coats off today.
I'll give you a pair of these.
This hair makes you believe me.
You can buy anything at night.
I'll buy it early in the evening.
I'll buy it early in the evening.
It sells early in the evening.
It's got a whole head.
Including balls
What we do for everyone is foxhair.
Yes, it is.
Then the fox's hair doesn't fall off.
You don't lose your hair when you buy a fox-haired fleece.
Yes, it is.
It's all colored on the ends of its hair.
Oh, my God.
No, not at all.
It's a little bit colored on the tip of its fur.
What's the average businessman doing to you?
The broken backs.
Yes, it is.
Yes, I did.
It's like this right-hand side.
But what we've got inside of us is a bunch of fur.
This ball is really good.
Yes, it is.
So many of the sisters say that this hairstyle is uncomfortable.
It's easy to wear
You see?
This place sees it as a magnetic pull.
Yes, it is.
It sucks and sucks like that.
It's very convenient.
It's a breath of fresh air.
Let's get this welded.
There's no black and no white.
You trust me.
Oh, yeah.
Black like fake hair.
It's white.
Let's get this one on today.
Snowball scarf because there's no way
My scarf is a fox-haired necklace.
Oh, my God.
I still have a shower in Xinjiang
Yes, it is.
All the sisters are fine with this scarf.
What I'm going to do today is:
490 is right.
Oh, yeah.
We're going to get the 450 straight.
It's a direct link to number 1.
All Tibetans in Xinjiang are included
All right?
The fox-haired collar
390 blasted a wave
Number 1 is a direct connection.
3 of them
Two and one
All three hundred and ninety sisters are going to get their headscarves.
Oh, my God.
390 buy fox hair and fur
Yes, I did.
This is a hairstyle that I'm going to wear in my granddaughter's house.
I'm going to make a dime of all the money I get.
They were all tricked.
This hairstyle is completely out of line with my oldest daughter's.
The number 390.
Yes, I did.
Buy real fox hair
It's really hairy.
You can feel it for yourself.
What a hairy bracelet.
There's something we're saying, baby.
I'm going home with a little bit of fur when I get it.
I'm not sure if it's true, but I've been thinking about it.
That's right.
You're going home great.
It's very exciting.
Shine the light on the hair.
It's the hair.
The flower's gone.
It didn't fall off.
Connecting number one
390 You can take it yourself.
Take it yourself.
I have to go get it.
A real man's hand.
All of us are limit priced.
And then let's have a feel for it.
This is my place.
It's a magnetic pull.
And then we'll show you where we can't see it.
In fact, you can't see it at all.
But what we're doing is very clever.
Yes, I did.
And then give it to everyone like this.
Feel it.
It's very convenient.
It's all right.
The series is strong.
Why don't you move it?
Yes, it is.
How can it not fall off?
And it's a really cool set.
I don't know what to put on it.
I've got another hairy hat like this.
I think a set like this is a good one.
If you want to make a demand,
Yes, it is.
That's what it feels like.
Go out and play.
The snow scene.
Take a photo of yourself.
It's all good.
And then I picked up a black bag.
Because black and pink collide.
That's what it feels like to be black pink.
Yes, I did.
It's very, very good.
