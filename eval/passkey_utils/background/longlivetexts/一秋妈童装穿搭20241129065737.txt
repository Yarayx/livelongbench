Do you think your sister is beautiful?
My sister's not pretty. I'm more beautiful.
And then I said, "What about me?"
You're beautiful without me.
It's very confident.
I mean, except for you.
You look beautiful.
Laughing and crying
He can't start.
Good for each other
It's been a cold lately.
I haven't had a cold for a week.
My son these days.
It's been the same since the cold.
Crying day after day.
I cried every day, and I wanted to get him a bag.
It's killing me to get people out.
How can a child be so disgusting?
Didn't the kid get a cold and cried?
He's all right.
But I'm used to crying when I might catch a cold.
And then it's there every day now.
For a moment, things went wrong in his eyes.
He came crying.
Wow, I really want to get started.
You are sick.
I owe you.
Actually, I'm not sick.
Every time I take a shelf.
Get a shelf.
He's afraid of you.
He's afraid of you.
He's scared of me.
I call three children my one-eyed god.
Oh, my God.
I'm not hitting them.
But my eyes are fierce.
In the morning.
All right, boys and girls.
I've always wanted to share my live stream.
Is it today?
It's not like I'm going back to the warehouse.
Wait until it snows.
Not yet.
Oh, my God.
You people.
You people.
But I've already received my shipment.
You haven't received the shipment yet.
Wait a minute.
It should be fast.
It's me.
I did.
I'm going to say this.
It's been too long.
It's been too long.
It's done.
I waited myself a whole month and a half.
Forty-five days
Four days.
Oh, my God.
I've been waiting a long time.
Good morning to you.
Today's Autumn is an interesting soul
She's not here.
I've got my uninteresting soul today.
I'll give you a live stream.
Watch out for the monkey.
Let's get the board down.
Our aunt was too crazy yesterday.
And then
Shango pulled her back and sealed her.
The seals were sent in a few days.
Oh, my God.
I'm afraid to pay for the live broadcast.
I haven't been here in days.
Is that true?
I'm on my way.
This one you're wearing.
Is that true?
It's really good.
Have you seen this one?
It's the kind of thing I wear every day.
Because it's too cold.
I drive an electric car today.
I'm wearing a warm-up vest.
And then there's the half-repaired high-heeled undershirt.
And then I added a coat.
It doesn't.
I can't live without it.
It's too cold.
I want to.
I want to talk about the weather.
You should go out in oil.
You shouldn't go out in other clothes.
Dress up and go out.
You see the little monkey wearing a statue today.
What are you doing?
The little monkey is frozen to death.
I told you.
He said yesterday
Full of babies
Just a little baby.
Put two on my arm.
What I'm wearing
The code of 160 yards
160 of them.
The number of codes 160
Welcome to our live chat room.
You bought four of these.
I sent three.
There's another 170 that hasn't been sent.
Is that true?
It's a feather.
For the feathers
I've got a sixth grade lamp.
It's gone again.
What do you mean?
Previously 7th grade
Oh, my God.
That's the question.
I don't know.
What are you doing?
The question is:
This is a shopping fan club.
You can shop.
Yes, I did.
He could only send two.
Less than two.
Contact the customer service
That little monkey.
I'm looking for clients.
If it doesn't work
You give it to me again.
My own number.
Send me a message in the background
Where's the scarf?
This is the one.
Yes, I did.
And then when we talk about this paragraph,
One of the people below asked:
What about Mark?
Where's the body armor?
I said this is the one.
It's a horse.
Where's the scarf?
He just doesn't listen.
It's a horse.
What's the matter?
I said
Usually remember
The one with the hair on my feet.
The Dog Show
I'm a fan of the eighth grade.
Is that true?
Oh, yeah.
Is there a thick bottom?
How thick do you want?
It's a thick bottom.
And then there's the
This one's on link six.
You can shoot first.
This is because there are not enough stocks.
Let me tell you.
I don't know about you.
I'm sure you can get it.
One hundred and seven can carry one hundred and twenty-five kilograms.
It's a hundred and thirty kilos.
There's nothing wrong with that.
You look at me.
One hundred and sixty-nine
One hundred and eleven kilograms
One hundred and twenty kilos you can wear.
It's a big deal.
Going up.
What are the activities of the fans?
There is no
They're just asking my fans to sign up.
How many episodes have they had?
What are you doing?
No activity for the time being.
No activity for the time being
Come on, we're ready to get started.
All right, then.
That's good.
You're in eighth grade.
I'm in 14th grade right now.
Look at you.
Oh, you guys are colorful.
Well, I started recommending it.
I'll give you the next one.
I think it's a warm-up.
This is really useful.
Because this is its
Continued cold weather
And then there's the warming effect.
I just gave the honest bag yesterday.
Take a bunch and throw it away.
He said
It's too stupid.
It's like our hands and feet are ice.
You know what I mean?
You know what?
We're going to die on ice.
It's just a matter of language.
It's true.
This kid needs it too.
When you were young, you wrote.
Do you not see?
I'm always with you.
Tell your dad.
Oh, my God.
Can't write
I can't write.
It's too stupid.
Sorry about that.
You buy this for the kids.
When a warm hand is used
It's good.
And it's kind of like a glove.
And then something like this.
A pack has two.
It's a couple.
What about a package?
There are ten.
That's five pairs.
Come to the sale.
9 to 8.
Thirty-two and one
Links later
Keep it down.
Washing towels
Wash the towel and put it on.
And then it's almost gone.
This is how the word opens.
Is that cute?
Yes, it is.
And what about this location?
It has a layer of this membrane.
What happens when you take off the membrane?
Your hand is in.
Oh, my God.
So it became a warm-up.
Yes, I did.
What about electric cars?
It's really convenient.
This is real.
I sold this last time.
Sold more than a thousand.
And then I wanted to say
Oh, my God.
That's what it takes.
Because this is my own channel in Shenzhen.
I feel like...
Awarded
And it's lovely too.
I bought one myself and came back to see it.
Oh, my God.
It's really helpful to find out.
And then I run back and share it with you.
So the grain is in the eye.
It's important to move.
They're all people who've eaten so much.
Is that true?
Oh, my God.
Of course not.
That's the hand I had when I was a kid.
That's when I started writing.
I can't write.
Then write it down.
And twisted seven and eight.
It's ugly.
I want to say what I write.
It's not that bad.
How cold is it?
I thought,
I want to play
But it doesn't work.
That's it.
It's hard to move your hands.
You buy this.
What is it?
