It's a whole bunch today.
When you first came on the air,
You want a sunny and beautiful hat in the winter?
I'm just going to record our first link.
This hat.
It's made of two layers of seaweed.
It's like a random pair of hats.
You can also fold the sides.
It's like a hood.
What about a hat like this?
It's the same as the sun.
How to Protect Your Brain and Ears
Men and women can wear uniforms.
You can wear a helmet.
It's like the sisters on the bike.
It's all about protecting your ears.
So compare the recommendations.
And the whole fabric.
It's made of two layers of seaweed.
The whole hat.
It's a circle bigger than a normal hat.
I'll show you.
Let's put another color on it.
The motivation is gray.
And then the second color is black.
That's the black thing you buy every day.
It's a lot lower.
Compared to the board.
It's a bit of a mess.
We're talking about winter clothes.
Are not the colors we wear the darker ones?
So you're going to record this.
It's the black one with the bright spot.
You look at the hat on the market.
A version of a hat from our family
Let's look at the contrast.
If the news sisters first came
You can see the link.
Two layers of seaweed
It just started.
Below is the thickness of our home.

And then what?
It's really on the market.
Including the full version
All the big faces
You can buy a link.
What about the whole fabric?
It's done in a high-density way.
Whole hat
You see?
The bright spots are tiny scattered.
It's a static look.
There are not many.
So that's what I'm saying.
It's one of the more exciting things.
It's the kind that looks better.
It's a black now.
A hat.
There are two ways to wear
All the big heads
It's all wearable.
At the same time
It's all about cash.
It's today.
It'll be out tomorrow morning.
It's black now.
And then what?
It's a gray one in our house.
The grey word
It's a good idea to bring it to our house.
Glasses in the snow
It's like two sets.
I'm scared of the cold.
I'll have another one.
Our Family Link 3 scarf
This set of words
It's all cash.

It takes days on the road.
The weather will only get colder.
It's never going to get hotter.
This is red.
What else?
One of the brownies in our house
Let's have a look.
Links 1 and 3
There's a way.
It's brown now.
It can be considered as one
A random pile of hats
You can also fold the sides.
Two layers of seaweed
It's like what's common on the market.
It's all that stuffed hat.
It's all this rough hairy hat.
It's not right to wear a hat.
Sorry about that.

It's better than that.
If you're a first time sister,
Let's see what color you want to see.
We can all climb up.
This is black.
The motivation is gray.
Little brother, give me that cup of tea.
It's like out there.
How did I get on the air?
The drill is locked.
And then what color did he recommend?
Grey
The second color is black.
See what you like.
The only thing I left was gray.
Grey is higher
There are six colors.
My sisters

Gloves on Link 8
Fingers can play cell phones
The whole thing.
It's done by a dragon that's tied up.
It's a family tradition.
So the wind doesn't come in.
It is thinner.
It won't be thick.
So the feeling of holding something.
It's all good.
Then put on the hat.
It's one of our homes.

No. 9 can be breathed out
Link number 4
It doesn't come out of its mouth.
But the two words
The thickness is 9.
Number four is thin
I can't see.
So what?
If you're in the north, you'll buy a 9 from our house.
South can buy Link 4
It's like listening to advice.
Don't say it again.
Our homes are thin or thick.
It's all thick and thin.
Including your own words

It's like I'm in the South.
I'm afraid of the cold.
