So the whole process of making it is complicated.
Production cycles are long.
I have very little in the way of cash.
It's not like C fabrics and dirty towels.
It's just a waste of time.
It's just a matter of getting hundreds of thousands of them.
I don't have that much.
Today's link number one is that you normally buy six sets.
109 I don't need to
Double Twelve coupons as long as you get them.
I'll tell you what.
89 pieces 9 6 packages used throughout the year
This was during the Twelve.
You can see the price.
But I don't have much cash.
How much cash is left on Link One?
And then there's the fourth one.
We'll have to buy it first.
The first four sisters who paid the bills successfully
I'm going to send it right away.
These four cash stocks are sold out.
Even if you're the fifth sister to come back.

This is already linked to number one.
Today's rhetoric is called a care cabinet.
I'm not sure if there's a normal way of life.
Oh, yeah.
I recommend this guilt.
I'm going to try it.
Feel it.
Because of the irregularity and greed in the way people live.
It's also important to remember that you're not going to be able to control your car's hydrochloride balance.
That's right.
It's especially late at night.
Love to have some tea, tea, coffee, and drinks
Living with her husband and boyfriend
More intimate and more frequent
The three meals are not very regular.
Previously frequent use of unclean towels
It's not easy to use clean toilet paper.
This is an unhealthy way of life and an impure means of living.
Once you've ruined your refrigerated car, you're going to have to get rid of it.
Your privacy is unstable.
It's resistant to the ability of your fungus to fall.
It's going down too.
That's right.
How long has it been?
There may be some minor problems, minor problems.
That's right.
It's a mess.
Hundreds of generations
The resistance was wet.
They resisted.
It's a meaningful yes.
Sisters, if you have this problem,
You must have used a woman's ink.
After the wedding ceremony.
You'll find that I'm really comfortable.
It's not that bad.
It's not that bad.
It's been a long time since I've been able to do that.
It's a woman-centered home.
Health and safety of the private sector
We're going to have to do some research on our products.
It's been decades.
That's right.
Big brands have quality
It's safe.
Guaranteed
So we specifically used the core ingredients of female fertilizers.
I'm in your cabinet.
Cabinet you wear every day.
So it's the same as a woman taking care of you every day.
Caregiver-type guitars must be kept on wearing
You insist on wearing it for six months.
After wearing it for a whole year
You'll see the difference.
And your bottom knife looks like it's getting cleaner.
The more comfortable you get through.
Some minor problems are starting to get less and less through.
Some dirty things are getting less and less through.
This is our real home care model.
And this cabinet.
Today I made this color.
This color is coming.
Cotton itself is round in color.
There are no dyes in it.
Aromatherapy
Methane
Filtering agents
I didn't add anything.
No such thing.
Because I use all the fabrics
They're all type A.
Young babies can be directly exposed
The skin rises up and wears
Implementation standards at maternal and infant level
I'll do it again.
More than average adult females
I want to be higher.
It's better to ensure safety.
It's not good.
I'm not adding anything.
What about today's link number one?
Why would anyone recommend buying six sets?
There are user vouchers.
Cheaper and more affordable
Cabinet, you have to wear it early.
No one should wear guilt.
It's better to take advantage of the low prices.
We're going to buy a few more pieces.
That's right.
The six-piece cabinet
You normally buy a 0.9.
I don't need it today.
Twenty-two user vouchers
As long as you can get
Reducing the number of people
Eighty-nine nine
Six packages for the whole year
This is during your campaign.
It's not easy to see.
But the sisters
I have three volumes.
We're ahead of the curve
The three volumes are illuminated.
Even if you bought a fourth.
My sister's not rolling
That can only be a zero.
And then the cabinet came round.
Any angle
In any direction.
It's very resilient.
Up and down.
I'm not upset.
You won't get your revenge.
Because of this payoff
We grew to 15 centimeters.
I've always wanted to buy a mortgage.
It's also 10 centimeters.
Have there been any side leaks?
Oh, yeah.
It's too small.
There's a lot of dirty stuff.
I can't keep up.
It'll just leak out.
That's right.
There's a line in the middle.
This border line.
Once the friction reaches your privacy department
It's not comfortable.
Like your normal blood.
Urine
Blood clots
Stay here.
That you're not clean.
The sink is not clean.
You wear it again.
Your personal safety

It must have affected them all.
That's right.
So I'm going to do this today.
It's about 15 centimeters.
Increase and expand
It's all about wrapping.
We need to be stronger.
Many of the previous lunar centers
Reproductive centers
They're all using this.
Because this is the bottom
It's a side leak.
The muscles are better glued.
It's not easy to worry about side leaks.
It's not a one-off.
You can wear it for three months.
No yellowing and no printing
Because this is the bottom
I'll give you a few more.
Sisters
After 150 baths
What about the military?
That means you wear it for 150 days.
The bottom is still washed.
I'm not going to wash the more yellow.
The more you wash, the more you print.
It can even connect you.
Blood traces from the spleen remain.
I can wash you.
Clean, clean, clean
This is our home.
The real type of care
And this year, all
The sisters I bought
Independent sealed packaging
Cutting down the army is killing the army.
The packaging is large
You can go straight up and wear it.
I don't need to wash my house.
After you get dirty.
Wash it again.
I think it's too little cash.
Sisters
It's kind of caring.
We're in the midst of a revival.
The key ingredients of the compound are:
I'll give it to you.
So the whole production process.
It's complicated
Production cycles are long.
I have very little in the way of cash.
Just like you.
The type of C fabric used
And the dirty towels.
It's just a waste of time.
It's just a matter of getting hundreds of thousands of them.
I can't produce that much.
I have to do it with Class A cotton.

That's your privacy.
It's against you.
I'm not sure if I'll be able to do that.
It's going down too.
That's right.
It's been a long time.
There may be some minor problems.
It's like a mouse.
A long white belt
The resistance was wet.
They resisted.
It's not easy to resist.
That's right.
Sisters
If you have this problem,
You must have used it.
That's right.
After washing the dye,
You'll find out
I'm really comfortable.
It's a lot of relief.
It's not that bad.
It's not that bad.
It's a lot cleaner than it actually is.
For the sake of complexion
It focuses on women.
Health and safety of the private sector
We're going to make a product of it.

It's been decades.
That's right.
Big brands have quality
There is security guaranteed.
So we specifically adopted
The core ingredients of the painters
I'm going to join your cabinet.
The guilt you wear every day.
It's the equivalent of a rebirth.
It's like taking care of you every day.
That's right.
24 hours a day
They're all working for you.
So the guilt of caring
I recommend you.
You have to stick with it.
You insist on wearing it for six months.
After wearing it for a whole year
You'll see.
Your Salary
It looks like it's getting cleaner.
The more comfortable you get through.
Some minor problems
Starting to cross less
Some dirty stuff.
It's also getting smaller and smaller.
And the guilt sister.
I made this color today.
This color is cotton.
The original cotton I brought with me
There are no dyes in it.
Directional Amine
Methane
Filtering agents
I didn't add anything.
It's made of cotton.
And what we're doing today
They're all type A fabrics.
Maternal and infant products
This is a maternal-baby specification.
I'm going to do this for you.
The implementation standards are also maternal and infant level.
So the execution standards for production are higher.
More protection is also needed.
I can at least guarantee.
Your health and safety
We're wearing this closet in our house.

Buying into our home
It's not going to make any difference.
So you want to buy a link number one.
We're going to have to make a move.
I'm going to pick up the voucher.
Then four rings of bullets.
Any angle
In any direction.
The resilience is great.
It's not like I'm standing on my shoulders.
It's better than not throwing your bounty.
This is a new upgrade this year.
Increase to 15 cm
You normally buy a mortgage.
It should be this short.
Have there been any side leaks?
It's too small.
It doesn't even contain your dirty stuff.
It's easy to get out.
That's right.
There's also a contact line in the middle.
This contact line.
Once the friction reaches your privacy zone
It's not comfortable.
That's right.
Like your flat sleeping bladder urine.
I'm writing to stay here.
You don't wash at all.
Internal dishes are unclean.
You wear it again.
Your personal safety
Health and health
It will also be affected.
That's right.
So I came today.
It's about 15 centimeters.
Increase and expand
Packaging
Emotional
It's better and stronger.
This year, many lunar centers.
We're also using fertility centers.
Because of this payoff
I'll give you a side leak.
The muscles are better.
It's easier to worry about sticking
The side leaks out.
That's right.
But it's not a one-time thing.
You can wear it for three months.
No yellowing and no printing
Because of this payoff
I'm gonna give you back to the military.

Cutting down the army is killing the army.
Packaging with ribbon
You can wear it straight up.
I don't need to wash my clothes.
After you get dirty.
It's all over again.
I'm too short on cash.
My sisters
It's the guilt of caregivers.
I'm in again.
Adding the core components of negative inflammatory bonds
So the whole guilt thing
The production process is complex.
Production cycles are long.
This means that there is very little cash in stock.
It's not like C fabrics.
And it's not like that dirty towel.
It's just a matter of getting paid.
It's just a matter of getting hundreds of thousands of them.
All I use is class A cotton.
So the production time is actually a bit long.

That's right.
I'm not sure if there's a normal way of life.
Oh, yeah.
I'm going to try this one.
Let's do this.
This is because of poor living conditions and unclean living supplies.
This will affect the balance of our privacy.
That's right.
For example, midnight after midnight.
Love to have some tea, tea, coffee, and drinks
Living with her husband and boyfriend
More intimate and more frequent
The three meals are not very regular.
Previously frequent use of unclean towels
And the toilet paper is unclean.
This is an unhealthy way of life and an impure means of living.
If you've broken down your privacy, you're going to lose your privacy.
Your privacy is fearless.
It's resistant to this capacity that you're all falling for.
It's going down too.
That's right.
How long has it been?
There may be some minor problems.
Yes, I did.
Oh, my God.
One Hundred and One
The resistance was wet.
They resisted.
What is the meaning of compensation?
That's right.
Sisters, if you have this problem,
You must have used that proverb.
That's right.
You'll find out after you've washed the rumours.
It's really comforting.
It's not that bad.

So we specifically used the core ingredients of the proverb.
Add in
The whole cabinet
It's what you wear every day.
It's the same as saying that Jay is taking care of you every day.
Yes, I did.
So, care-type guilt sisters, you insist on wearing
You must be able to see the results.
That's right.
Keep it up for six months.
After wearing it for a whole year
You'll see.
The cleaner you go through your counter.
The more comfortable you get through.
Some minor problems are starting to get less and less through.
Some dirty stuff, it's getting less and less through.
This is our real care cabinet.
That's right.
And today, this cabinet sisters,
I only do this one color.
This color is the round surface of the cotton itself.
There are no dyes in it.
Aromatic ammonia
Methane
I didn't add any of the filters.
It's not.
It's the colour of cotton itself.
That's right.
So all the fabrics we use today are type A.
It can be worn directly on the skin of infants and young children.
That's right.
Because I'm using mother-baby direct.
Level standards to give you guilt.
It's higher than the direct standards of adults.
Yes, I did.
So its safety and health benefits are better for protecting you.
There is no chemical dye in it.

Find your time.
And then the cabinet came round.
Any angle

It's very resilient.
Up and down.
The waist is not dense.
I'm not going to pay you back.
That's right.
This is because the mortgage has grown to a total of 15 centimetres.
No other colors.
It's all colourless cotton.
That's right.
And then the collateral went up to 15 centimeters.
You normally buy that for 10 cents.
There is.
