Where's warm, where's going, where is hot, where are your feet warm, all your body warm, your feet cool all your feet cold, frightening, cold, cold
If you're 44 yards thick, which link is going to be the thickest?
Number nine, number ten, this side is thick. Number seven, nine, ten.
thick and heavy, and the thick neck,
If you want to get a little thick, we're going to have seven, eight, nine, ten, seventeen.
And the number 18 can be the number 19.
And then this is where you want a thick mouth, and this is the one you want to cut short, and you can take the number 19.
And the one that's particularly short, you can take the number 19, the female fiddle, the number 2.
What's the point of a chick like you coming here?
What's the word for a box, five pairs of thick words? Look inside.
There are no samples in the live room. I can't see them on this side of the room.
Oh, you can only say the words in this. It's a towel circle. That's the towel in the house.
It looks like the towel in your house, it looks like a towel inside the necklace, and it has a hair ring inside it.
And then this shaker has a better shaker effect.
And then this is our link number one, come over here and say it again, oh, link number 1 male.
38-48 This coat changed in winter wearing cold feet in winter cold feet at the bottom of winter ice cold feet
He wanted to be like a boat, and he wanted to wear a warm coat that made the bottom of his feet hard to see.
Don't shoot, don't buy, just shoot the number one link. Come on, sisters, the last three minutes.
Last three minutes, ladies and gentlemen, I'm here to talk to you about the number one link in men.
38-48 Number two link female 35-41 necklace two cylinders high five colors
I've got the middle cylinder in my hand right, and I have the middle and the high cylinders four centimeters apart, so let's see how it works out.
The mid-cylinder is 8 cm high, 12 cm high and 4 cm wide, and can reach the lower leg.
The two cylinders in height, five colors in color, and then the winter height. This is mainly worn in winter.
Come on, let's see if winter is cool or cold.
I'd like to wear a big box of ice cream underneath my feet and, frankly, I want to put on a shower or a warm shower.
And when you get home, the number two link is five pairs in your hand.
You don't have to shoot a necklace all winter, you don' t have to buy it, and you've got to get your necklace done all winter.
It's the word for this necklace at the bottom of your foot, at the foot of your feet, where you're afraid of the cold, where your feet are cold.
Thanks for the graffiti. Thanks for your support.
Be assured that what you see is what you get. This is one of the things you have to wear before you try it.
Let's get to the point where we really like to be happy, really warm, not to be unhappy.
We can't do anything like we told the main character, so we can go back.
In the house of the mother of the bride, the man number one, the woman number two, the middle cylinder eight centimetres, the high cylinder twelve centimetres and the medium cylinder four centimetres.
Two cylinders high, five colours, pre-selected colour, high cylinder.
The main change of the coat is the winter wear, the cold feet in the winter, the frosty feet at the bottom of the winter.
It's not just that I want to wear a shower cap, but also a heating pad to keep my feet warm and warm.
Give me the first link line, a big box, five pairs of big pairs, the whole of the whole pair of pairs take home to the bottom of our house, the position of the ankles.
Where you're afraid of the cold, where your feet are cold, and where you don't see all the graphene.
The whole little foot is warming up, warm up, come on, last minute.
So last minute, guys, I've made a note, first of all, that our house is made of real paper, and we've just been on the air.
I've never taken a picture before, and I didn't buy one before, so let's see, all the coins are made of heavy gold and graphene, and we're going to do 1,338 waves, and our house is going to be 1,583.
It's really graphene with a little red stuffing that can't be fooled, and at the same time it's not fake.
So, what's the long-range performance going to do? Come on, we're going to warm up for a second and it's going to be 1.4.
This necklace is heated and warm, it's heated from the bottom of the foot, and this necklace isn't thick.
We don't have a thick coat, and this necklace is not thick, but we think it's in the bottom of the foot.
It's made of graphene.
So what we're talking about is that the coat in our house is heated from the bottom of the feet.
Walking to the warm, warm to warm, walking to the hot, hot to warm feet warm, all body warm, feet cool, all cold, afraid of cold, scared of cold.
I'm going to have to go to the bathroom and see if I can get my hands on it.
Two cylinders high, five colours bright red, re-rolled cylinder high, middle cylinder 8 cm high, 12 cm high and 4 cm high.
Two cylinders high, five colors as long as it's white.
Now, look at this, if you're white, you can go straight to five pairs of white, and see if you shoot a man or a woman.
There's five pairs of whites in the men and women, and then there's a five-pairs of white, and I'm going to put it right on the five-piece, and that's the white side.
And this is the old man's cylinder, and this is where the male number 1 and the female number 2 are all the long cylinders.
The long cylinder is right on this side of our house, the high cylinder, is long enough.
Let's pick the colors first, then the winter heights. Come on, let's go home.
Little assistant, get a feel for the last ride of our car. Grab the time, grab the speed.
Welcome to the live show. Let's say it again.
We're afraid of cold, afraid of the cold, scared of the ice, cold under the feet, cold and cold, to tell the truth, we both want to wear a shower guard.
I'm not sure if I want to wear a heating pad, but I want my feet to warm up, and it's hot, and I don't know what to do.
Link 1 is the whole thing that we're talking about today in the video.
Oh, tonight, it's six o'clock, and we're on our way to the last stop.
I can't leave tonight, I can only send you something special tomorrow morning, something special, something absolutely special.
I can't do that, because we're also looking at orders, and you can see that our orders are bigger.
To tell you the truth, I'm going in this afternoon and I'll send it all to you because it's six o'clock.
It's all about organizing logistics, organizing the delivery line.
This is the time when the shipment will come to our house, according to the order you ordered and ordered it.
So let's say you want an early shot.
What about this monkey that we wear in the winter, the man who comes to our house, who wears 48?
Is it possible for a male to wear a link number 1 up to 48?
The two barrels are five colors, first select the color and then choose the barrel.
The main thing is our new home this year.
Graphene resistive heat pumps are located throughout the base of our house in the position of the ankles
Where you're afraid of the cold, where your feet are cold.
It's all heavy gold, graphene, where the coconut goes where it's warm, where it goes hot.
We all know that the whole little footstool is warm, warm, hot.
My feet are warm, my body is warm, and my feet are cold, and I'm afraid of the cold.
We're afraid of the cold and cold under our feet, and frankly, we both want to wear a shower mask.
I want to wear a heating pad to keep my feet warm and warm.
Give me the back link.
It's positioned all over the bottom of your foot, the position of your ankle where you're afraid of the cold.
Where it's cold and cold, there's nothing.
All the weight of the gold is graphene, and the bottom of the whole foot is where you go, where you're going, where it's warm, where the heat is going.
Let's take a look at the 12 centimeters.
The mid-cylinder is 8 cm high and the mid- cylinder is 4 cm high.
Two cylinders high, five colours, eight centimetres high, twelve centimetres wide.
In the middle of the cylinder, there's a four-centimeter difference in the position of the bottom of the neck.
The location of your feet where you're afraid of the cold.
It's all gold and graphene, just like your little toe.
It's like moving a walking hot tub, going where it's warm.
Come on, let's see what's inside.
It's the same inside and out, so let's see if there isn't.
It's all gold and graphene.
Where the graphene neck goes, where it's warm, where the heat goes.
The whole little footstool is warm, warm, hot, warm.
Cold feet full of cold, frightened of the cold, cold underfoot, freezing cold.
To tell you the truth, we both want to wear shock absorbers and warmers.
I don't want to buy anything.
What about our cotton cotton? Let's look at the cotton stuff.
It's all about Chinese pork sausage cotton in Xinjiang.
I've got two lines of sand, one of a kind, and the other of a sort.
Cotton content reaches 92.3%
Let's go to the high-cotton table with the little red table.
Link number three, baby, I'm talking about a sample in the live chat room.
It's not like I didn't show you a sample.
Thank you so much for not sending us a brooch.
I'm sorry, because what we're saying now is that we really can't.
This price is going to go down forever.
