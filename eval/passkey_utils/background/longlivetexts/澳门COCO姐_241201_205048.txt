Come back and show them.
Oh, my God.
Is this the strap that you take off when you are working or wearing hot?
Oh, my God.
This is the backpack that will free your hands.
Yes, I did.
He's right on his back.

So he doesn't need you to take it anymore, huh?

Don't you have a crush on me?
What's up?
Did you?
I want to ask you something.
Those brothers who have been slitting their clothes.
It's true.
You always have to.
There is.
A professional version of the water slide cost $10,000
It's always worth $56,000.
I want to.
You're going to make me wear a wet suit, aren't you going to bankrupt me?
I'm going to fold this three.
I can only wear two high-heeled sweaters.
Two things.
You guys are kidding.
No, not at all.

I want you to choose.
Are you kidding me?
I'm going to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on advertising.

I'll give you the price of my sweater.
You are sending videos.
I'm going to give you another thousand bucks.
It's hundreds of thousands.

It's not as expensive as you think it is to wear a slippery shirt.
Oh, yeah.

I drank too much.
What's that supposed to do?
Oh, my God.
I want you to get up early and not sleep well.
Oh, yeah.
I've been dreaming of a motherfucker.
Oh, yeah.
I'm not sure what you're looking for.
You did so well.

Don't do that.

You have to remember.
Your confidence was given to you by your sister.

Don't get any real shit out of it.

So don't tell me your sister doesn't see you, huh?
You can't even get a $10 earpiece.
You said it was a change of scenery.
Change it up.
The price of shorts
You can get a slide suit.
Oh, yeah.
You're still in the bathroom.
She's not from the village either.
This is a phone call to Mac.
You told him to make 5,000 bucks.
That's good.
That's enough.
I can tell you thirty seconds.
I saw the slippers.
Don't blow it.
Let's get this straight.
Oh, my God.
Don't blow the whistle.
100 percent of the water slide
5000 headphones
Oh, yeah.
If one word is not enough, two words are not enough.
That's enough.
Help me out for 10,000.
That's good.
You said you'd give me 38,000 men.
I don't know where you 10,000 come from.
Help me get ten thousand.

I believe there are 38,000 brothers on the air.
A lot of people should.
I've been renting 5,600 slippers for a while.
Yes, it is.
Isn't this the one you can rent for 5,600?
This is a professional version of the water slide.
Yes, I did.
First of all, do you like this one?
I like it.
I like it.
I don't like the 10 million.
That's right.
Don't think the price is cheap.
That's right.
It's made of fabric.

It's called Shogun 1 with a coating.
Uncoated oil goes into the lake.

It's the design of the league.
Yes, I did.
Don't ask me why.
If you don't know,
That's because you didn't wear a wetsuit.
Yes, it is.
Are there any more things to say about security?
That would make sense.

Wool
It's all based on highly sophisticated computer compression technology.
I'm not running.
Yes, I did.
How much do you pay for a wool tie?
Oh, my God.
This isn't a woolly dress.
It's too stupid.
This is a professional version of the ski suit.
Remember, 100 people liked it before.
Today, I'm going to challenge the Internet.
Remember that.
I'm sure there are a lot of brothers who bought the Double 11 back in 1880.
Yes, I did.
In 1880, I bought a professional ski suit.
I feel like the ceiling is gone. You can't find another person.
Come and get it.
Play big today.
That's good.
Challenging the Internet
Help me get out of here with 10,000.

Listen to your mother.
That's good.
When you hear 10,000, I'll put a price on it.
That's good.
If the link doesn't last three seconds,
I'm going to link you.
That's four million dollars for a black and blue woman.
What do you call challenging the Internet?
No one dares to do what I do.
No, not at all.

That's as long as you're willing to buy it.
This one's going bankrupt.
You don't have to connect first.
A brother just said:
The A's?
Is that false?
How can we do that today?
It's a little different from the 1800 I bought for my boss.
Don't buy it first.
Yes, I did.
You could say a sister is ugly.
I don't blame your brother at all.
You're so powerful in a pocket.
I have an opinion.
As for my strong brother, don't shoot me first.
Yes, I did.

Let's start with the shipping bill.
If it's not the quality of healthcare, take it home.
Give it all back.
That's good.
I'm worried about 199 being different from my boss's 1800.
Yes, I did.
If it's not the same, you'll lose four times as much in 1800.
You got it.
You turned on the recording screen.
Are you up?
There is no
I'm really mad at you.
No more.
What are you doing?
When did I call you?
It's full of it.
You know what?
Are you really up?
Are you really up?
Don't mess with me.

How many times have I told you I've really supported you?
I said, as long as you're brave enough to get somebody else to hit you, give it back to me.
I'm too full.
I'm holding you up. This isn't a language suit. This is a ski suit.
Professional books
It's a skiing suit.
Call Mike right away.

Selling teachers to teachers is not enough for you two losers.
I'm not sure.
That's good.
I'm sorry, brothers and sisters.
I'm asking you to make 10,000, you give me 10,000, or 30,000.
You're dreaming, you two.
I don't want to go to work.
Oh, yeah.
Next year, I'll have both of them.

What about your 5,600 shares of skiing suits?
This is the only layer of material that is visible from the outside.
The preconceived notion is filled wool.
So it was a professional edition.
It's called Shogun One.
Shutterfly number one
And there's one more thing you have to remember.
There must be a BB sign on the front.
There's a lot of crap on the Internet.
Yes, I did.
It's not just a rush.
It doesn't have a BB label.
It's the rush.

I can.
Brother who wants to get married can wear
Are the girls wearing them?
I can.
Down to 18 and up to 80
Maybe for men and women.
That's not true.
Don't ask me about my ski suit.
I'm going to fix the headphones.
And then what?
Oh, my God.
It's a Bluetooth headset with a charging station.
The point is that it's a dual host.
The two hosts
What do you call a double host?
It can only connect computers.
It's only connected to cell phones.
It's only connected to cell phones.
Don't be a double host.
It's worth it.
Come and see me.
Set him up.
It's here.
They both said

Take the double host.

My skiing suit is just getting old.
There's a lot of crazy stuff you can't play with.

It's too stupid.
There are also gifts.
This is a gift
To all of you.
They want to get married.
Do you want to get married?
Do you want a mansion?
Why do you want to get married?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
I want to marry a woman.
That's not what it takes to get married.
The mansion.
The mansion.
It's like this.
It's like a mansion.
Brother, you paid a courier fee.
The mansion I gave you.
Oh, my God.
It's not good.
You're ready to make a delivery.
How much is the courier charge?
You're ready for delivery.
The housewife gave it to you.
Oh, my God.

Don't shoot, brother, you can't take it.
That's not the kind of guilt you can buy a dozen times.
It's inside.
The temperature of the full cell population is very high and it changes colour directly.
It's warm.
In the winter and spring, he's better than his brother.
Come and arrange a mansion for my brother.
That's good.
Is your brother happy?
You're going to be happy.
Yes, I did.
