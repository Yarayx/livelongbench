Welcome to Nanking
Welcome, I am 77.
Welcome to Iris.
Welcome to Cocoa.
Welcome to the ZZZ.
Welcome to the world.
It's a little far away today.
It's late.
Why not?
Because before I started.
And this one in the battle with them.
This is a gift.
It's four guys.
And then I want more of it now.
It's too much sugar.
This is what the other live broadcasters say.
I can't beat the price of aluminum.
It's like this.
It's basically the floor.
That's what you're seeing right now.
Including Double 11
Including Twelve
Including Carnival
It's the price of the floor.
This one just came in, too.
That's the strap.
And then the store.
That's me.
Send it to me.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And then there's the
I asked you a question.
Just ask one question.
But if you've given your kids or bought your own whey protein,
And then how much did you buy for a box?
The button works in the comment area.
That's good.
There's probably only 20 lactic acid proteins.
No matter how many articles.
Instead of a box, how much did you buy?
Buttons in the comment area
How much for a box?
You're buying milk protein for your kids.
How much is a box worth?
Linked to comment area
All right, then.
How much is a box worth?
Buttons in the comment area
The button in the comment area is 318.
Are there any more?
338
Are there any more?
That's about it.
How much do you pay for this milk protein?
We all know that whey protein is expensive.
That's right.
It's just that a lot of people in our group are looking for lactic acid.
I'm going to change this season.
I did.
The villa
It's a different season this season.
My kids have been doing it over and over again.
That's right.
It's been a while since we've had a little wind blowing through the grass.
Or maybe you're worried about having kids.
Opening of the school year
Including kindergarten
It's easy for babies to drop a piece.
That's right.
My children often do.
It's not easy.
Caring for Children
We're all tired of it.
The key is to blame the children themselves.
That's right.
A lot of people would buy their kids some lactic acid.
It's not an IQ tax.
In fact, during breastfeeding.
It's the first few days after the baby's birth.
The breastfeeding.
Breastfeeding
It's high in lactic iron.
It is not chemically synthesized.
It's extracted naturally.
So what about breastfeeding?
It's only a few days after they were born.
That's right.
You're going to lower the back.
It's been a long time coming.
So what?
The seasons change from season to season
Or the winter.
You can buy your kids some lactic acid.
That's what we all bought.
But no matter what brand of whey protein it is.
What brands of lactose proteins are there?
I bought it.
How much did you buy?
Can be clicked in the comment area
All right, then.
It's basically over 300.
And then there's the discount.
For example, double 11.

It's cheap to get to 268.
But it's not over yet.
All of you turn on this link right now.
The numbers have to be 3 haha.
The little red bag next door could be a couple of dollars cheaper.
Number of shots 3
That's 698.
698 is right.
And then I added five.
The first five.
After filming, you have to remember to take the words out.
I'm here.
You get 100 days of iron.
Today is not 100 days.
That's 102 days.

Just like that.
Soaked up.
In the water
I'm not sure.
In that milk.
It's breast milk.
Or boil it in the milk powder.
I'm not sure if I'll be able to do that.
This is a very good lactic acid protein you can buy.
New flag for 2024

Oh, my God.
Ordinary words
We bought basically 39.8 billion boxes.
The discount was 308.

The child's immune system decreases.
It's not.
He's not dependent.
Especially this season.
Are you worried?
This baby is easily manipulated.
It's like a mountain range.
There's a wind blowing through the grass.
This kid is easy to get caught up in.
This is the end of my house.
Me and my niece.
My niece is too young.
He can't drink.
This is six months.
Collect more babies
After the child added the corrosion
You can also add it directly to the corrosion.

Including babies
Breastfeeding is early.
It's about poor health and so on and so forth.

That's what it's all about.
I'm not a teacher.
This is Otley's lactic iron protein.
I'll say it again.
He's not just a lacto-iron.
He also added IDP.
It's a third-generation defense protein.
There's also immunoglobulin.
And then there's this VC.
We all know what VC is.
Just one reason.
And then there's
Some kids don't like to eat.

This kindergarten has collapsed a lot.
That's right.
It's been a long time coming.
The wind is blowing.
It's easy to get involved.
Or maybe you think he's easy to trick.
He's not dependent.
Just after winter.

And of course, it's worth it.
That's 268.
But the number is three.

The key is that the child is guilty.
It hurts the most.
There are 15.
Watching children especially be punished
It hurts the most.
Oh, my God.

It's nothing but lactic acid.
There's also an IDP.
IDP is actually more expensive.
Lithium iron
That's it.
It has a higher content.
What is it?
Every hundred kilometers
This is equivalent to
12 kg
Excretion of iron
Extracted whey protein
and eight kilograms
Excretion of iron

And that's what I'm saying.
What do you mean?
That's the equivalent of

Breastfeeding
Breastfeeding knows what.
Yes, it is.
That's it.
You were just born.
It's all about people.
He's definitely not human.
He's a cow.

There are many.
My kids don't like to eat.
My kids don't like to eat.
My kids don't like to eat.
The one who doesn't like to eat
Take care of yourself.
There's also the mind.

And there's this doctor.
It's the stomach.
Children's
The baby's stomach is uncomfortable
What's wrong with your stomach?
He's eating badly.
At the same time, he was

I've chosen a lot for you too.
Because we're in the crowd.
There are too many people.
I need milk iron.
This is you.
You didn't.
You've never shared
Lithium iron
Why before?
Didn't share it?
In fact, there is one.
Why is it important?
You might not know.
Because you're not doing this.
You don't know.
It's whey protein.
It didn't have one before
What are the criteria?
There is no
That's what some people say.
I'm high in lactic iron.
I'm high.
This is me.
Can contain more than 1000 mg
More than 1000 mg
More than 2000 mg
What's wrong with you?
There is no problem.
Why not?
Because of its country
There is no testing standard.

The new flag
It's the date of production.
It was in October.
This is a new national standard.
Well, then.
This is GB5009.299.0-2024.
That's according to this flag.
You know what?
How to distinguish?
What brand?
This milk iron is good.
What brand of lactic acid is bad?
You know what?
That's it.
It's the new flag.
You buy it later.
It's not about buying brands.
This lactic iron protein
And remember.
Adopting the new flag
You know what?
There's a word for it.
Criteria for judging
And then
The key is the price.
Basically, no matter what.
You've bought it before.
What brand is lactic acid?
It's basically over 300.
More than 400

It's today.
I'm giving it to you as an exhibition.
That's the way it is.
You can have one of these.
This is a free trial
And there is this price.
It's the same as driving a bicycle.
Year of the Carriage
This is the time.
It's basically just this one studio.
It's like an iron-protein field.
And supporting everyone to go online.
Guarantee is Otley's thing.
It's this cranberry.
Teacher of Yoga
We're going to do this for everyone.
Like iron proteins
Because he was doing the same thing.
Then we can do it.
I can.
After that, you have to count to three.
698 is right.
Keep the cold
It's all right.
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter if you're in the cold.
You know.
You're right, if you say
You see somewhere else.
What does Li Xiaojun include?
There are other places that are cheaper than our live broadcasts.
Come back and tell me.
I'm here to give you a discount.
All right, then.
You're playing that three-dollar little red bag.
It's also cheaper to buy a three-dollar bill.
You can also grab a belt.
There's three or four more.
Yes, I did.
Click on this link number three.
Number three is 698.
That's right.
That's right.
One box is 199.
Basically, you can see all the brands of lactic acid protein on the market.
It's less than $200.
And it can be more than 500 milligrams.
There is no
698
698 is right.
Some individuals
Each person has a $20 voucher.
That's not our problem.
That's what people do.
Some people don't.
This isn't mine.
You have your own $20 voucher.
Go and see for yourselves.
Some people have
He didn't.
He didn't.
You're the only one.
There are 19 more.
It's just you.
All right, then.
How long can three boxes last?
Three boxes can last 104 days.
You can drink all winter.
Three and a half months.
You can drink in December.
January
February
There's also the March 15 issue.
It's going live until next year's festival.
Live broadcast
Is that true?
I've been drinking until next year's live show.
It's just this season.
And then he stopped.
There is no dependence
It's not about drinking.
He's like this.
After stopping
This kid doesn't go.
Immunity decreased
No, not at all.
He is not dependent.
There is no dependence
It's this season.
Give it to yourself.
It's okay to give the kids a drink.
It's the end of the high season.
It's not.
It's been a long time.
That's what you're worried about
Children are easy to get into this season.
Or maybe your child is your own child.
It's the body.
Children without other people's homes
That's cool.
So you're pissed off.
That's right.
Including babies
and the date-palms,
and the date-palms,
And then this.
It's the weak ones, and so on.
Or to say
You have all sorts of reasons.
No way to breastfeed
Why emphasize breastfeeding?
For breastfeeding
Not just that.
This is his offer
Nutrition
That energy matter
And then there's that.
Milk iron in breast milk
It's better than this milk powder.
Especially breastfeeding.
Breastfeeding
High in lactic iron
He's not chemically synthetic.
This is not a chemical synthesis.
He's the one who extracted it.
But say
He's from this milk.
Not from breast milk.
Extracted from milk
And it's not just that.
You've just had your baby.
The last few days
This is breast milk.
High in lactic iron
But it's getting less and less backward.
It's just this one.
The seasons change.
You can give it to your kids.
Or the one who got pregnant.
Then add a little lactic acid.
And it's not just
It's just whey protein.
I told you.
Lithium iron
And then there's this IDP.
You can go look for it.
What is IDP?
That's it.
It can be commonly understood as
Third generation proteins
These are all active proteins.
I said,
I forgot the most important thing.
It's you.
This is the time of the rush.
Or directly into the mouth.
It's good to drink.
Or fall into the milk.
Put it in the milk powder.
Or falling into corrosion.
Less than 37 degrees
Or below 40 degrees.
Don't let it get wet.
You know what I mean?
It's an active protein.
It is dynamic.
You're going to get water.
It's soaked in water.
You say it doesn't work.
Don't take the water.
It's cold water.
Hot water below 40 degrees
It's all right.
In fact, cold water can be dissolved.
It's very well developed.
It's warm water.
The baby can drink.
You don't need too much hot water.
Just like me.
Do you see?
It's like this.
And it tastes really good.
It is.
The taste of this milk powder
It doesn't have to be in the fridge.
It's just a matter of time before the light goes off.
It's easy to use.
The key is that children love to drink.
You don't have to push it.
It's the end of the season
It's easy to fall.
That's right.
It's easy to get involved.
A little milk protein.
That's right.
This winter.
This autumn
This winter.
Don't get sick or anything.
Of course it is.
That's one of the ways.
Including the usual words
Pay attention to movement
Pay attention to movement
That's right.
Balance of diet
Sleep well
Different methods
Combined
This improves immunity.
It's not
After you drink it.
You can do whatever you want.
Let the kids sleep at night.
It's not easy.
On this snowy day
It's very warm inside.
And then you sneak out and sneak in.
Get out and get in.
Cold and hot exchange
Wasn't that looking for a cold?
Wasn't that a cold?
All right, then.
You know what?
I got it.
This one.
That's a lot of sisters.
Let's look for this lactic iron protein.
If you want to choose one,
It's the lactate protein thing.
I'm not buying it.
Buy a good one if you want to buy one.
It's really good.
Come on now.

You can compare it anywhere.
I'll try it later.
Have a drink.
Drinking to your satisfaction
Try it for free.
My kids don't like to drink
Or you can drink to your own pregnant woman.
You don't like to drink.
All are free to return
There is a return shipping insurance
Do you remember?
I remember.
It's a second-generation good.
That's it.
This is what this yoga teacher is doing.
This is the milk iron protein made by the yoga teacher.
Now we can take a number one.
Let's take three.
698 is right.
Come with me.
Oh, my God.
Putting out a warrant
Let's get one of these.
Take the word out.
It's been 104 days since we've had a good milk protein.
This cover.
I'll wait a few days.
I've been waiting a couple of days.
You're on your way.
That's good.
It's too far from me.
Put the words on the public screen.
It's a 104-day-old milk protein.
The button on the public screen
Give it to me.
I came here, I come here.
You're all right.
Finish it.
Oh, my God.
It's a good one.
It's 104 days of lactic acid.
It's like a 104-day good milk protein.
It's a good milk protein for 104 days.

Oh, my God.
This is a mysterious shark.
I'm looking at you.
Oh, no, not at all.
Oh, my God.
The Mysterious Shark
I'll give you an extra drink.
Oh, my God.
The Mysterious Shark
I'm watching you, huh?
And then
Or is it?
Who is this?
This is it.
I got you.
You little pearl.
It's a good milk protein for 104 days.
I got you, little pearl.
I'll give you an extra drink.
Oh, my God.
I'll give you an extra drink.
That's what you eat for 30 days.
So basically, you can go anywhere and buy that amount, huh?
What's the concept?
Oh, my God.
This one.
He's got a lot of protein.
This is 550 milligrams.
IDP is the third-generation vaccine protein, 833 mg.
What is the concept?
This is equivalent to
12G of extracted lactate and 8G extracted IPB
Oh, my God.
And then
There's also 400 mg of immunoglobulin.
There's also a VC.
VC is 30 milligrams.
There's also tin.
The ink is 5 milligrams.
Oh, my God.
That includes my kids who don't like to eat.
My kids don't like to eat.
Maybe parents will buy their kids some ink.
Oh, my God.
VC
VC, too.
It's also
It's the same with VC.
I don't like to eat vegetables
That's the one.
I know.
The opposite is true.
He is the protector of the whole.
Protecting You
Protecting Children
He's not just on a lactate.
Of course, lactic acid is one of the most important proteins.
Oh, my God.
That includes us.
It's a complex one.
If you say you're worried,
It's easy for kids to get caught up in this season.
It's easy to get caught up in the wind.
And then this baby.
There's a baby that cuts the date.
The date palm.
Or maybe some kids just eat milk powder.
Oh, my God.
Just some milk powder.
He doesn't drink any breast milk.
And so on and so forth.
It's the new season.
The weather is getting colder.
It's easy to get involved.
The trick is nothing.
We're tired of parents taking care of their children.
That's right.
Including spending money on hospitals
It doesn't matter how much money you spend.
That's right.
Sometimes you take your kids to the hospital.
You're in line for a long time.
Oh, my God.
It's worth a thousand or two thousand dollars.
That's right.
Some children are completely unhealthy.
That's what pneumonia is.
It's a bit of a mess.
That's a lot.
It doesn't matter.
It's no use spending money.
The key is that the child is guilty.
It's the chicken.
Your reversal is all we can do.
It's good to eat.
Have a good night's sleep.
Buy these for the kids.
This is my son's drink.
It's like this.
That's how you get into the water.
It's very simple.
It's a day at a time.
It's all in a day.
It tastes good.
You'll try it when you get it.
Go for a drink.
It's true that this one is portable and unusable.
You've been drinking all these bags.
199 Ah!
698 divided by 3.5
You can do that with a calculator.
698 divided by 3.5.
It's basically in the accent.
You can't see the price.
This is a month's worth of packaging.
There's only 20 of them.
Look at the numbers.
You're equal to 199 buys 30 of them.
You know what?
Yes, I did.
Some 299 bought only 20 pieces.
There's no more than 500.
You can drink for three and a half months.
That means you don't have to bury your kids all winter without having to buy them milk and eggs.
And you've been through winter.
You can't drink.
Because he's not dependent.
I'm not saying yes.

Oh, my God.
Do you remember?
I just made it clear.
It's a good idea to wash it with warm water below 40 degrees.
Don't use the water.
It's so expensive
When you look back, you're dead.
I'm totally blind.
Oh, my God.
It's not easy to buy something so expensive.
It's a waste of water.
Oh, my God.

That's what we've been looking for.
I never shared it with you.
It's whey protein.
It's called whey protein.
It's not really an IQ tax.
I've never shared anything before.
And one of the reasons why this is so important is that
It's not enough.
Because there are many brands of lactic iron.
It's called high content.
But there is no uniform test method.
It's like saying
I said I weighed 200 pounds.
He said he weighed 150 pounds.
But in reality, they're the same.
Why not?
The scale is different.
There's a balance now.

And whey protein is not an IQ tax.
Because of this breastfeeding
Especially the first few days after your baby is born.
This breastfeeding
Why is milk iron not healthy?
In particular, breastfeeding is precious.
It's because of breastfeeding.
These are active proteins that are rich in lactic iron.
It's not chemical synthesis.
It's extracted.
But it's not.
By September 2024,
There is no new flag.
You know what?
The year 2024 is just over.
Just two months ago.
Two months ago
Of course, this was last year.
It was announced in advance.
It was officially declared two months ago.
It's the only thing I've ever seen.
In 2024,
After this new flag,
There's only one standard.
You know what?
For example,
I said I was 200 pounds.
He says he weighs 150 pounds.
But it's not.
They're just as heavy.
Why not?
The scale is different.
You know what?
You use your scales.
I use my scales.
I can do whatever I want.
I said my milk protein is 1000 mg.
I was 2,000 milligrams.
I have 10,000 milligrams.
You're just saying
Why not?
There are different methods of testing.
Starting in September 2024
State demands for unification
All milk proteins on the market
It's the only way to test it.
It's like this.
You can tell.
This milk protein is good.
It's not good.
Unified
Unified Standards
You got it.
I got it.
I don't know if I understand.
I see.
There are 25 generations.
So before that,
Including 2023
Including 2022
Including 2021
I've never shared milk protein with anyone.
This is one of the most important reasons.
The second is important.
That's the teacher.
He asked us to share.
I don't know what to do.
It's this one.
Help me with this.
Let's get this teacher out there.
It's something you can taste.
After you receive
It can also give a real evaluation.
This isn't a good drink.
Children don't like to drink.
You drink for a while.
He didn't see any effect for a day or two.
I told you.
It's like a day or two.
This kid's fine.
I'm sure he's got hormones in him.
You know.
He did.
This thing.
He's one of them.
At least you should be.
Two weeks, three weeks
It's a long process.
That's right.
It's just that you're not good.
You can also comment on the comment section.
Basically, your comments.
It's something that every teacher can see.
It will.
We'll see.
Get this straight.
And then you get your hands on it.
That's 104 days.
It's basically

Everyone has to spend 300 dollars.

It's hard.
I'll give you an extra set.
She's a great grandmother.
The grandmother.
It's for me.
Yes, I did.
It's for me.
It is true.
In fact, it is.

What's the matter with the kids?
I'm tired of taking care of him.
It doesn't matter.
Including spending more money.
How to care for children
It doesn't matter.
The key is that children are guilty.
If you're worried, too.
It's time for this new season.
Autumn and Winter
It's easy to get involved.
Including yourself.
It's not just kids.
This is a lucky one.
That's right.
It's good to eat.
Have a good night.
Then buy this.
Feed the children
That's all we can do.
It's not.
I can still make it.
That's right.
You can't say

What?
Can't get out
Flowers in the greenhouse
Can't walk out the door
Can't be with anyone.

That's right.
The next one is in kindergarten.
Put two down.

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.

Raise the barrel
Including buying the pumpkin.
Feed the children
It's over.
The words on the back
Don't eat
There is no dependence.
It's not saying "ah".
This is the winter you've been through.
The children didn't eat.
His immune system is down.
It's not.
You can stop at any time.
It's him.
And you don't have to eat for long.
No need
That's right.
It's this autumn and winter.
What are the high seasons?
Because every year is like every season is like fall and winter, it's easy to get high.
That's right.
That's all right.
Oh, my God.
The key is to buy a good lactic acid.
What do you mean?
In this GB5009.299-2024
Before this new national emblem of the country was launched
There is no particularly good test method.
It's a criterion for determining whether or not this protein is good.
Some people would say that I have 1000 mg.
Some people have 500 milligrams, etc.
He's different.
It can be more than 500 milligrams.
Except for lactic acid.
And IDP is the third-generation vaccine.
There's also immunoglobulin.
What is this concept?
That's the equivalent of 12 kilograms of lactose extracted from whey.
And eight kilograms of IDP extracted from milkweed.
Then add the VC.
We all know what VC is.
We all know what VC is.
It's also
And then there's this monkey.

I can.
Three major A's
Yeah, yeah.
Especially that one.
This is especially the case.
Especially you.
Especially in your case.
Oh, my God.
That's three A's.
I answered you.
You will see.
This is especially true for you.
Including some
Including children
and the date-palms,
Oh, my God.
And the date-palm,
Or the roots.
No breast milk
Just drink.
I only drink milk powder.
All right, then.
I've got my sister.
Put the word out.
It's not up.
I can't.
It's milk powder that contains lactic iron.
But if it's capable of achieving such a high level of active lactic iron,
It's basically very expensive, very expensive.
When you're brewing milk powder
You can just add a little bit to it.
Oh, my God.
The red bag is gone.
It's not.
Tell me out loud.
Oh, my God.
Tell me out loud.
This one.
Remember that.
All of you.
There are ways to tweak the links
Remember that.
Hot water below 40 degrees.
Don't use the water.
When you open the water, you get wet and live.
These are all active proteins.
It's about the same as what you eat.
It's all active proteins.
It is dynamic.
You're going to get water.
It's a waste.
It doesn't matter.
Hot water below 40 degrees.
For example, say you're making milk powder.
Aren't you using 70 degrees water?
It's 55 degrees in the winter.
It's 55 degrees.
Or maybe 60 degrees.
Some people use water at 75 degrees.
and so on.
Of course, every brand of milk powder is different.
You follow the brand of milk powder.
It demands how much you use
No matter how many times you go.
But if you're at 55 degrees,
Or 70 degrees of water.
How to make milk powder
Don't rush to Riga.
I'll wait until I'm done with the milk powder.
The milk powder is cold.
It's cold.
You're going to go in there and you're gonna do it.
It just boils right out.
That's how it is.
You use water to boil alone.
It tastes like milk powder.
It's the way it sounds.
It has a good taste.
And that's the usual thing.
Don't put it in the fridge.
Keep the lights on and off.
It's easy to use.
It's basically a change of season.
It's a great way to feed your kids.
Including yourself.
There's a mother who's pregnant.
I don't know what I'm going to do.
And then what we can do is
It's good to eat.
Have a good night.
Get more exercise with your kids
That's right.
Movement can also improve this.
Oh, my God.
And then buy this for the kids.
I'll buy that milk blood again.
Let's eat these.
That's all we can do.
We do all the things we have to do.
And finally, the child is still alive.
It's easy.
It's easy.
That's not cool.
Yes, it is.
The old mother has done her best.
I'm not saying yes.
What's the matter with him?
It's hard to serve him afterwards.
Serving him is a lot harder.
It's better to serve him than spend money.
That's right.
Running back and forth.
It's the back and forth.
And so on and so forth.
The key is that the child is guilty.
All right, then.
He's not dependent.
You've been through this winter
It's over this fall.
After this winter, I stopped drinking.
It's not that his immunity is down.
It's not.
There is no dependence
You can stop at any time.
Guarantee is Otley's thing.
It was a teacher's eyewitness account.
I'll buy that milk blood again.
It's a lot of blood.

It's all in the milk.
They're all added to lactose.
But it doesn't add that much.

It's like this.
Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.
That's two more bags.

That's why I gave you seven bags.
We can get two of these bags out and try them out.
