They say it's a card.
I can't get a card.
This place.
Let's have a little.
So I'm not moving around here.

I'm sorry. I know.
I'm halfway there.
Then I'll give you a messy shield.
It's a mess.
Our first phase is mainly to get out of the way.
It's all in our bodies.
What's in that womb?
Get it out.
The second stage is to nourish our intestines.
Sorry about that.
The fourth and final stage is to replenish our essence.
Let's get out after the moon.
It's red in white.
Our skin is special in every way.
The situation is particularly good.
And when we put those things in line,
That's something we can't eat.
Although some are quite complementary
But we have something waiting for us.
The road is clear.
I'm going to eat.
What are we going to do after the road is clear?
We need to feed our gut.
If we eat too much potatoes in our intestines,
Too much fat eating on the moon
It's a mess in your toilet.
How many times a day?
Because we're sitting on the moon.
Our intestines are very tender.
So if we get to this
If you're causing your diarrhea
When you're in a mess.
