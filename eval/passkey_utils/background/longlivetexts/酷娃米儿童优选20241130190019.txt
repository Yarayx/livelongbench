The tooth is starting to grind.
Have a good night.
Good evening. It's just in time.
Today's broadcast is just in time.
Welcome to the world. Good evening. Good night.
Have you all had dinner, sisters?
We've all had dinner.
We're at 7:00 p.m. and we're going to start on time.
All the new powders can be a bit of a focus.
It's a bit of a distraction.
It's a good idea to start a business.
It's a good thing we're on the air every time.
It's good to be able to do a little bit more between live broadcasts.
Wait a minute. Have a meal.
Let's get our superbags first.
There's no door, you can just click on it.
It's okay to just click to participate.
And there's not a lot of people on the live stream who are carrying bags.
You can get involved first.
The Medal still exists today.
Or something.
Do you think the cowboys are going to be new?
There should be a back door, but there isn't one here.
Currently, there is no live broadcast.
Exhibition without a baby
Let's have a moment.
I'd like to know if you're going to be able to do a little bit more in between live broadcasts.
And we're going to have a lot of styles tonight.
Is that grey?
This gray should be a little rusty.
There's going to be a little bit, and it's really warm.
It's thin, but it's actually warm.
It's really warm because it's a really heating-up material.
It's been a while since I've had a baby.
But I've got two hits myself tonight.
One is this thing on my body.
And then there's another one that's white.
It's really nice to wear.
Including the white baby in the cargo hold.
The purple jacket in the cargo hold
I'll buy a few yards.
That's enough to buy a ticket.
You don't have to buy a couple of yards, just buy one.
I'm almost ready to start a baby.
I'm going to start a lot of philanthropy.
Let's get some clothes.
It looks like the clothes are full.
It's supposed to be small.
It's also a special price.
And then this color actually looks really good over the years.
It's also the most popular Angla red this year.
And it's not that thin.
It's thick and thin.
Look at the chicken inside.
It's made of olive oil.
And what about this one?
It's kind of a thin pattern.
And it's also a kind of digital transfer.
It's not hardcore.
And then this is my live-streaming special.
Common agricultural clothing
Our house was sold for 35 to 39.
Yes, I did.
But today's 29 doesn't.
It's only 19 blocks away.
The same thing.
The thinner one's up.
I have a necklace too.
And my neck is getting thin.
He was just talking about it.
Is the broadcast thin?
It's not thin.
But it's a very good version.
And then the jewel is thicker.
A-strength foam
She's wearing a baby doll.
All of you can speed up your height and buy a little bit bigger.
This thin piece is a 90-yard code.
And that's a good match.
You can wear it alone.
It can also be combined with clothing.
It's all right, baby.
This price really smells good.
Because it's only 19 bucks.
That's the baby.
It's not the middle ground.
All of the subtitles.
It's only on the air that you can explain.
I'll be right over.
I'll give you a set.
It's also a mixed bag.
And I think this set looks good.
The colours look good.
It's like a green screen feeling.
And then there's the A-force.
What about this one?
It's also very thick.
A coat with a hat on
One more rabbit.
I've always been a host.
The combined set sold for $69
That's right.
But what about this?
Because it's just a little code.
Maybe it's like only 90,100 yards.
All you can do is speed up your height.
This is my host's special.
A whole set only costs $29.
It's the same.
This is a special treasure.
The kids are 29 in total.
The baby has only a few things to say about this.
Use one.
So we're going to sell this price in our hostels.
If I could wear it.
This is where you can load up the treasure.
It's all class A stuff.
And the colours I think are really pretty.
Men's and women's lamps wear 29 bucks
Don't call it a coat in my show.
You can't even buy a chicken.
It's a whole set of 29 dollars today.
If our children can't wear them
You can buy a delivery.
But it is true.
And our home is full of beautiful clothes.
It must have been delivered.
Come on, the kids are up.
It's not a single thing.
I'll give you one more.
This is the style of my talk show.
Can you give me another look at this helmet?
It's probably a little less than that.
The baby is also in Class A.
And then this is the kind of style that it's in the minds of the people.
And the fact that it's actually very, very hot.
This is a tight-fitting material on top.
and a cotton candy.
But the cotton isn't very thick.
It's also been added to my presentation today.
It's all special jewelry.
It's really good.
This one looks really good.
But it's a little less frosty.
This is a cleaning house for kids.
I don't want to go to my host's house for 49.
We're only going for $39.
That's what kids are for.
Mark 49
A child's armor
Today's broadcast is special baby
I sent the wrong price.
It's $49.
Then the adult has three digits.
S, M, L, three-dimensional
But adults shouldn't bring babies.
But what about this?
All adults have a wave of right and wrong.
All the horses have a wave.
But what about this?
The adults came to my showroom for a price.
We're not going to 89.
It's only 75 bucks.
It's the same.
Is this done?
That's fast.
The baby's already taken the baby.
The price hasn't been announced yet.
But what about this?
Adults are out of baggage.
But the kids have a live-streaming scale.
90 yards to 140 yards
It's all up to 10 plates.
It's thick.
This is the average thickness.
Cotton cotton
It's made of cotton.
But this doesn't mean it's thick.
Let me see these little details of yours.
It's made of cotton.
And the fabrics are really high quality.
It's good to see this.
It's really good.
And put it here.
It's like the feeling of being transported.
And then I put this style back into it.
Get your clothes off.
This dress is just for a little girl's boyfriend.
Don't buy a pumpkin.
It's also a heartwarming style.
And that's what Ali did.
And that's what this one adds to.
Protected materials
Keep it up.
It's not very thick.
And I love this little flower.
This is also a special on my live stream.
It's just a matter of time.
Don't be 49 today.
We only paid 35 bucks.
It's the same.
It's colorful.
My father's horses were all unbreakable.
But this one looks really good.
Little girls buy boyfriends not to wear
It's really good.
Dad's really good looking.
Ali has no material.
You guys can go ahead and shoot.
$35
What is the meaning of the Dalai Lama?
I bought another ML today.
There's also ML.
Of course, it was $59.
But there are only a few of each size.
There's only one M code.
There are only two U-code live broadcasts.
I'll be right back.
Dad's S-code is definitely not.
This price is certainly affordable.
My father.
Because it's special.
The price is definitely lower than the cost price.
In the clearinghouse
It's not even about horses.
I'm going to go over the card.
Children
I'll give you another look.
I'm on the air.
This set.
This is our little perfume.
But it's like there's only 911.
That's really cool.
Dad's good looking.
Look at these little details.
It's rough granite.
In fact, the whole thing is made of silk.
But the whole fabric isn't hard.
And it's made of cotton.
It's the size of a thin cotton jacket.
A whole set in my hostel.
Today is a special day.
It's like buying perfume.
The price is not cheap.
You bought a single coat.
It's more than $100.
But when I was on the show,
A whole set today.
The clearance price was only $69.
The same price
I've got this set in my hand.
Our house is 90 yards long.
It's all up and accelerating.
Buy a little more.
It's very refined.
It has a black jacket inside.
Here's another pair of all-black underwear.
It's really superoxygen.
But what?
It's a bit of a shame.
That's the end of it.
Disconnect my main room.
They can't all lay eggs.
There are only three Marabours.
There's no break.
I'm going through.
Come on, like this.
I'm going to give the big district a benefit first.
I'll ask the host.
All the old pollen.
Is this what you have taken away?
Don't let me do it again.
It's usually something like this.
It's our annual income.
And the new annual salary
It's usually in the presentation.
It's the only price I've ever paid.
That's what I'm doing again.
It's a middle layer.
It's a substitute for a sweater.
It's a substitute for clothing.
A radar for warming
And I'm with my own son.
It's all over the winter.
This radar is inseparable.
Because it's in the middle.
It's also comfortable.
And then what?
You look like you're comparatively thin
But it's really warming up.
It's a double-sided self-use.
The whole fabric
It's all about the material.
It's the same.
And they are full of bones.
No bone marrow
Including the entire necklace
The bullet is bigger.
It's totally free to wear.
Inside the collar
It's also a complete waste of time.
There is no bone marrow.
Then this, which has no scripture,
It's more than 400 guests.
The size is 90 yards to 140 yards.
No need for cargo storage
You're waiting for the pre-sale
It's all steam vapor.
There will be 10 colors.
This is my live broadcast.
At the time, it was a negative price.
These three types of materials
That's what we do every year.
And the old powder should be
After we bought it.
This is a daily price.
25 bucks in my live broadcast
It's already cheap.
But today it's $25.
I don't want to.
Full price tag
It's only 18 to 8.
The same price
It's in my hand.
It's our 90 yard yard gym.
No. 3 connections are not picked up.
I can't have a baby.
Yellow is any color.
It's hard to get rid of horses.
How can I pay?
Little Milk Skin is live.
It's temporary.
And then this color.
I'll give it to you guys.
Hands on this.
It's a caress.
This is the case in Kazakhstan.
It's actually male and female.
I can wear it.
I'm a middle school girl.
You can buy purple.
We can also wear our pink.
Another girl
What is it?
It's all green.
Little boy
Except for pink.
It's not our purple color.
It's all right.
Category A materials
Baby, you listen to me.
You're in someone else's house.
It's a special one.
Maybe I won't buy it.
I wouldn't buy it.
Why not?
Because there's a lot of specials.
Things are cheap.
But in our live broadcasts
It's a brand across the board.
The price of something over a meter
It's okay to take a blind shot.
It's really nice to wear
It's not class A.
It's not a share.
No share lines
Delivery within five days
Five days of treasure
How do you get two?
Do you believe me?
Because of this dress.
Wait till you lose.
I want to buy it back, but I don't have it.
This is our new annual budget.
I've got a new one.
I'm on the air now.
Prices are high.
It's still $188.
The children are already on board.
Hands on this.
It's 90 yards.
It's 90 yards.
It's hard to break the rules.
It's almost as if there's nothing left.
The size is worse.
All of them.
This isn't attached.
Baby, you listen to me.
It's in there.
What to wear
Put on a T.
It's a cotton T-shirt inside.
It has to be cotton.
I'm wearing a big one inside.
Put this in the middle.
Out of here again.
It's okay to wear a coat.
It's what you look at.
Looks like it's thin.
It's really warm.
And it's a very good wash.
Good dry materials
Look at the color.
I'll give you the right color.
In your hand, this is brown.
And then there's a purple in the middle.
The other three are what we have.
Milk brown
Yellow
Green
Purple
They all have babies.
You can choose.
It's more colorful.
But what?
It's a bit of a disconnect.
You want to buy
What color do you want?
I may not be able to go alone.
I hope you can.
Choose the size and the color.
130 yards without scale
It's not a single thing.
They all had no babies.
The Featherbox
It's not live today.
But we'll have a big cotton warehouse tonight.
And you shall add four layers of beauty.
Super cotton book hosted by
You are.
Baby white
Didn't you eat?
It's not a single thing.
I'm going to buy it.
The baby?
This one's really worth buying.
Do you believe that I have $188?
This price is not pressurized.
I'm just going to say this price.
It's so cheap you can't afford it.
I'm sure you won't mind.
But you believe me.
It's what you buy.
It must have been well tested.
It's not about quality.
It's all class A fabrics.
And it is of high quality.
It's the first time I've ever heard of this.
It's the whole fabric.
It's all about the material.
It's the same.
And the texture of the whole thing.
It's very subtle.
And it's all the same.
There is no recognized line of credit.
They're all four-in-six.
It's a live show.
I'll have to wait a little while.
Do I have to buy the treasure?
I'm not going to talk about that.
And it's usually only in my explanation.
It's only a matter of time before it starts.
I'm going to go up to this little hole first.
A baby's necklace is only 80 lines long
Very few.
I don't know how old powder and
I don't know if I'm going to get it.
It's about this in every case.
All the babies are crying.
Baby, I was quick.
This is a weekly private group.
Super-looking new yearbook
It's a little bit of an add-on.
That feeling of cleanliness
And then the whole skin is very weak.
And the material of a bunch of cakes.
This sand is on the sixth floor.
And the top is very thin.
This is a hand-crafted Chinese dish.
The back is made of invisible drag chains.
And this is a very thick thing.
It's an honour to be here.
It's a big baby.
But this is a new episode of my live show.
I can't sell.
The scale can.
Don't buy the size.
We didn't get to the 89 live.
It's only $59 at the end.
I need a piece.
It's only 80.
It's only 80.
You can see my sales figures.
I can't say anything more.
Can't anything add to the treasure?
That's a good one for you guys.
It's really high quality.
And in fact, we rarely make this kind of stuff in our homes.
Private materials are more expensive.
And it's more difficult to do.
I did it this year.
Then the quality details must be very good.
But the price is only $59.
With whom do you see this?
There are over 100 of them.
Are there more than 100 of them?
It's a great place to live.
I'll have to wait a little while.
Take a look inside.
You can't.
But I'm worried about you guys.
It's not like there's any potatoes in it.
This one's in there.
And it's a material that makes a few olympics.
The baby is thick and thick.
The thickness.
Last year's temperature was higher than last year.
That's a lot higher.
That's what you can wear outdoors.
But if the temperature is lower,
So you can still wear a coat outside the closet.
You can wear it outdoors.
Fish coat
It's all about the baby numbers.
That's what I'm saying.
Baby, you're all right.
This is our prime code in the hand.
It's only three yards.
I can't add one.
Baby's only three digits.
I can't really add one.
I'm going to scream at the kids.
I'll ask the baby.
Don't look inside that sweater.
This coat is on the air today.
The scale might be a little bit more.
Including white
Yesterday was nothing.
But today it is white.
It's the same with black camels.
Baby, let's talk about this.
Our materials
Baby It's a Barabbas
The same amount of money was thrown out of the jacket.
I'll ask the children.
Is this the fan you bought?
Have you ever bought one before?
I'm going to talk about this.
We've been doing this for four years.
But over the past four years, there's been a lot more supermarket sales.
And I haven't adjusted the price.
And then the dress was a double hole.
A power-free material
The whole fabric and the details of the whole thing
It's the same.
It's a convenient way to make a mouthpiece.
Look at the whole thing.
The details in this are very good.
And the whole garment, it has no scripture.
The collar is highball.
It's half-high.
The collar is just high.
You can wear any jacket you want.
And it lasts three seasons.
It can be worn in spring, autumn and winter.
It's not going to change without a fight this year.
And it doesn't really shrink.
Including this dress, you know?
How do you dress, how do you wash?
It will not deform.
The price of my live broadcast
The baby was not fully delivered.
We only paid 36 bucks.
It's the same.
It's all right.
Baby, refresh yourselves and take a baby.
I haven't had a scale for days.
Sorry about that.
Baby, you listen to me.
In fact, it can sometimes come as a surprise.
Sometimes you're on the air without robbers.
It's live, then.
It's all going on, and there might be some stock.
I finally bought a jacket.
Are you happy?
I can't get any more puppy babies.
I really can't.
Then don't buy all that coat.
This code is super-standard.
And today's live broadcast is rice and white.
It's only 121314 tons.
But you can actually buy it.
Our black and orange
Orange is the current live broadcast format.
It's all up to 140 yards.
There's another one that's our black.
Black has a code of 100 yards to 130 yards.
100 yards to 130 yards.
Pink is currently only 90 meters wide.
I can't grow up.
You can buy orange.
I have a very high incidence of this orange in my home.
It's orange and it's high-color.
Very high
I want all the fans who haven't bought it live.
So this one, you try it first.
You'll only be with me a few times in my sweater.
You only buy my house.
We've been making sweaters for 23 years.
It's a lot of brands.
It's all right.
What are you doing here?
Mark's truth is that this brand is a substitute.
Then the sweater sold for 36 bucks.
Really good use.
And he didn't have to say anything special.
It's a good idea to start directly.
It's a good idea to start directly.
The Marines have been robbing for five days
I finally got the baby.
It's nice to have that one.
But what if we don't eat?
They can't add eggs.
Come on, I'm going to kill the Canlababs.
That's a good one for you guys.
A baby like this.
I'm going to ask my baby sister.
You don't have to look at this sticky bag first.
You can put together a set of sticky bags.
It's a good idea to put a set together.
So it looks good.
And that's the difference between it and how it's handled.
In fact, it's the same way.
But like this, it's more like a fight.
It's a whole different feeling to deal with it.
It's a little bit higher in overall texture.
And this gives you our new money.
It's also a decentralized price
It's a cotton feel.
It's a soft fabric.
Cotton and more resilient
The numbers are high.
It's about taking care of the mother we're most worried about.
I'm worried about how easy it is to get rid of them.
It's just a matter of time before the heat is blown away.
The bigger the fabric, the bigger it gets.
But this whole version is very close.
It's a high-heeled design.
All around, let's take a look.
It's just a bunch of these bare-mouthed chickens that are 5 centimeters high.
And that's what you've been adding to.
This is a thick, warm oven.
And the whole body is boneless.
There is no rolling line
Including this position of the entire cylinder
It's all about the kids.
This is the position of its heel.
It's not red.
It's a great way to keep up with the kids.
More submissive
It doesn't say slide down.
It's not a slippery slope at all.
This is thick.
It's going to go to zero.
There's nothing wrong with zero and three and five.
Any city in the south can winter.
But what about this?
It's all on my live feed as an A-Lead.
We don't have a 3N9
The whole yard is 90 meters to 150 meters high.
We only paid $29.
The same goes for borrowing.
I can't add any more messages.
The baby can't help it.
I'm sure you can.
My grandfather told me.
It's only 80.
I can't sell a single one.
And then there's this one in my hand.
It's our 90-yard card.
I don't know.
That's what it looks like.
That's what fat people wear.
As long as you buy according to your height, you're fine.
The kids are fat.
He won't.
Children can also learn the numbers.
It's not easy for babies to learn.
There's no such thing as a live broadcast
The baby can't get up
There is no such thing as a "small yellow machine".
The baby was also temporarily absent.
The baby has to wait for delivery.
It's about to ship.
It's not up yet.
And then there's four colors.
It's black in my hand.
Recommended to buy a black one first
It's the end of the second half.
A lot of the clothes are red.
It's black.
What coat?
Black is a superhero.
And then this set is our white.
White is also recommended.
It's white.
It's better to bring this.
The sweetest style
It's the feeling of freshness.
It's that pink.
It's not like we're going to go to the gym afterwards.
It's pink.
It's yellow.
Or purple.
It looks good in white.
That's right.
It's very close to the format.
He really won't fall.
It's not going to turn off the lights.
And the baby doesn't really flower.
You believe I'm all right.
It's just like that.
We have a lot of fans.
It should have been with us last year.
I might buy it.
And we're at the bottom.
It's really wet.
You can give it to your kids.
At least wear it all year long.
You represent when you need to wear underwear.
Today's kids are wearing dresses.
What's with the long coat?
Then play this, baby.
